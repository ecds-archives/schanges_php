<p>In a final vote showing overwhelming support from members of Congress in the South and elsewhere, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Voting Rights Act virtually as amended earlier by the House Judiciary Committee. By a margin of 389 to 24, the House now sends to the Senate a bill with amendments that will permit some Southern local governments to bail out from Section 5, the provision of the Act that requires them to get the approval of the U.S. Justice Department before an act or practice affecting voting is implemented.</p>

<p>The bill also makes lawsuits on voting discrimination easier to prove and contains an unexpected change which will bar voters from receiving assistance in the ballot booth unless they are blind or disabled.</p>

<p>The debate on the bill began Friday, October 2, when Rep. Don Edwards of California, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, introduced H.R. 3112. Presenting the first arguments for the passage of the Act, Rep. Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat and co-sponsor of the bill, assured his colleagues that the Edwards subcommittee had "found overwhelming evidence that the Act is still needed.... I want to emphasize that this bill is important not only to those vitally affected citizens," Glickman said, "but also because it reinforces to the rest of the world our fundamental democratic principles."</p>

<p>The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Peter Rodino, a Democrat of New Jersey, called the moment a "historic day" and explained that the proposed bill had amendments "because fairness dictated that an avenue to escape the preclearance requirements should be afforded those jurisdictions that have had a history of complying with the law."</p>

<p>The first vote on the bill came Monday, October 5, when Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois, proposed a "technical" amendment to change the bailout provisions. Hyde proposed to exclude consent decrees reached by litigants in federal court on voting cases as a standard showing a local or state government was not protecting voting rights and could not bail out of the preclearance requirements. Hyde contended that consent decrees were not admissions of wrongdoing even though they are orders of the court to which all parties agree that changes will be made in practices which plaintiffs had claimed were discriminatory. The Illinois Republican said that the present bill would discourage settlements.</p>

<p>Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin quickly took issue with Hyde, declaring that "approximately half of the voting rights cases are resolved as consent decrees, settlements, or agreements" and while they rarely contain admissions of guilt "the agreements are signed because litigation is highly likely to result in a judgment that the jurisdiction's voting practices or methods of election are discriminatory." Another Republican, Rep. Hamilton Fish of New York, echoed Sensenbrenner's objection to the change saying "these consent decrees have been largely entered into late in the proceedings and ... proves the point that the jurisdiction could see that it was about to lose."</p>

<p>The roll call vote showed strong support for the bailout provisions
prepared by the Edwards subcommittee. The margin, 92 to 284, also
showed
<pb n="3"/>
that Southern representatives would not maintain a "solid South" in opposition to the passage of H.R. 3112. Almost four out of ten of the Southern delegation voted in support of the stronger subcommittee bill.</p>

<p>During the first day of debate, the split in the Southern delegation was evident. While Texas Democrats Martin Frost and Sam Hall voiced support for the subcommittee's bill, Republican Rep. James Collins of Texas joined Caldwell Butler and Thomas Bliley of Virginia and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina-all Southern Republicans-in expressing opposition.</p>

<p>Mickey Leland, a Houston Democrat and one of only two of the South's black members of Congress, spoke early reminding his colleagues that "historical accidents called racism and other kinds of obstacles placed in our paths have indeed disallowed Hispanics and blacks to participate in the process of democracy equally. It takes longer than twenty or thirty years to correct those historical accidents," Leland said.</p>

<p>Congressmen Butler of Virginia and Campbell of South Carolina joined Henry Hyde as the most vocal opponents of H.R. 3112 and as the sponsors of most floor amendments. Saying that it was "sheer demagoguery to suggest that all amendments to the committee bill represent a back door attempt to kill this legislation," Campbell described his amendments as "sensible and constructive proposals that will give the Voting Rights Act the kind of broad, bipartisan consensus it deserves ... and to work for its acceptance here and in South Carolina."</p>

<p>The closest vote on changes in the bailout provisions came on the question of whether local Southern federal courts should replace the federal court in the District of Columbia, as the law now provides, as the forum where local jurisdictions try to bail out from preclearance. Caldwell Butler, the sponsor of the amendment, argued that "it is more reasonable to hear these cases where they arise instead of Washington, D.C. The substance of local judicial prejudice does not in my view exist. . . . "</p>

<p>Rep. Rodino, one of the sponsors of the original 1965 Act, replied, "that time and experience have shown us quite clearly that the D.C. court was the proper court to implement protection for the Fifteenth Amendment. Congress originally placed jurisdiction in the District Court for the District of Columbia to assure uniform interpretation and enforcement of the Act," he said.</p>

<p>Illinois Democrat Harold Washington, a member of the Congressional Black caucus, noted that "there have been any number of cases in Southern district courts which illustrated the difficulty in obtaining relief in voting rights litigation even when the facts and the law were clear, very clear." The amendment failed by a vote of 132 in support and 277 in opposition. About 3/5 of the South's members voted for the Butler amendment.</p>

<p>Before the debate had concluded late in the evening of October 5, ten more amendments would be proposed to alter the House bill and all were rejected. Until the final vote, most Southern members did support the weakening amendments. (See, for example, Chart # 1). In some instances, the words and votes of Southern representatives did not always match.</p>

<p>On the first day of debate Congressman Sam Hall of Texas made brief remarks concluding "I am strongly supportive of H.R 3112." In subsequent votes, however, Rep. Hall voted to amend H.R. 3112 with the Butler amendment and a later amendment proposed by Rep. Campbell to permit states to bail out of preclearance if two-thirds of the local governments; in the state had a good record.</p>

<p>One of the few Southern Congressmen who voted for the House bill in
every vote was Democrat Bo Ginn of south Georgia. A faithful
conservative, Ginn told reporters the
<pb n="4"/>
reasons: "It means little to whites. It means a whole lot to blacks." Rep. Ginn's district is more than 1/3 black and he is also an announced candidate for governor in Georgia where he will be courting a large number of black votes in Atlanta and other cities in the state.</p>

<p>Before the voting on October 5, Rep. Campbell had proposed several of his amendments to the sponsors of the bill and to civil rights groups as a way for them to assure enough votes for the Act's passage. Administrative assistants and legislative counsels for other Congressional opponents of the Edwards subcommittee's bill also spent time on the telephone in late September predicting that the "hardliners" among civil rights groups, who would not agree to further compromises, would be responsible for crippling the Act when drastic floor amendments were proposed.</p>

<p>Further compromises were apparently unnecessary. On all recorded votes proponents of floor amendments never received as many as one third of the total votes cast.</p>

<p>Strong opposition had been expected to extending the Act's bilingual provisions that guarantee ballots and election materials are printed in both English and the language of a substantial minority population where it exists. Robert McClory, Republican of Illinois, proposed to delete the extension of the bilingual provisions, arguing that the provision was unnecessary and costly. Describing the bilingual ballot as "a luxury that is known to no other country in the world," he argued that the federal government had no right to place this financial burden on state and local governments.</p>

<p>Other representatives quickly replied to McClory's amendment. New York's Hamilton Fish disagreed with McClory's estimates of cost, as did other representatives whose districts have bilingual ballots.</p>

<p>In the middle of the debate, Rep. Leland began speaking in
Spanish. Saying to his colleagues that "if you cannot understand me,
nor can you understand 21 percent of the adult citizens of El Paso,
Texas..." The majority leader of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, also
spoke in opposition to the amendment. McClory's amendment failed, 128 to 284.</p>

<p>Filling more than one hundred pages of small print in the <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>, the debate on the Act was often predictable, seldom rancorous, and usually filled with facts and figures. There were, however, a few humorous moments. New York Rep. Robert Garcia told of a conversation with former HEW Secretary Califano as the two discussed the rich ethnic heritage of America. In an apparent game of one-upmanship, Califano boasted that it was an Italian, Christopher Columbus, who discovered America. "But I reminded the Secretary, that it may have been an Italian who discovered America, but it was a Hispanic woman who gave him the money to get here," remarked Garcia, referring obviously to the Queen of Spain who financed Columbus' voyage.</p>

<p>At another moment, in the debate on the bilingual provisions, Rep. Wright was attempting to find the right term to describe the "pluralistic American culture" which was not a "single stream of sameness like ores poured into a melting pot." Apparently finding no other analogy, the Texan suggested that the American culture did not blend together but was "more like a fruitcake."</p>

<p>The only amendment added to the subcommittee's bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Millicent Fenwick of New Jersey. The change prohibits any person from receiving assistance in the polling booth unless the voter is blind or physically incapacitated.</p>

<p>The debate on the amendment was brief, and the need for it was never fully explained. Fenwick mentioned the importance of the "secret ballot" and said that the addition "would seek to keep the bosses out of the ballot booth. The voter should not be accompanied unless blind or physically incapacitated, unable to vote on their own. All the instruction and assistance can be given in the hall."</p>

<p>Although Fenwick supported the subcommittee bill in all other respects, the only other person to speak in favor of her change was Rep. Hyde. "I plead ... let us have a voice vote on this one. Let us prevail," Hyde remarked to Edwards. "Let us say that the gentleman was not so foolishly consistent as to reject what is unquestionably an improvement to this great bill."</p>

<p>Edwards did speak against the amendment, saying that his "subcommittee which heard over 100 witnesses did not receive any testimony on this issue ... and that the responsibility for assisting persons at the voting booth is governed by state law and "is not properly a federal responsibility." With less than 10 minutes of debate, the amendment was passed by voice vote.</p>

<p>The Fenwick amendment may present substantial problems for voters
with little education and in some areas where bilingual ballots are
not available to Spanish-speaking minorities. In Sumter County,
Alabama, for example, white officials who remain hostile to blacks
continue to control election procedures. The average level of
education for blacks in the county is about 8 years. In the next
several months the county is expected to change from paper ballots to
voting machines for the first time. Without assistance from anyone of
their choosing at the polls, as provided by state law, and with the
elections run by hostile whites, elderly black voters may not be able
to cast their vote within the few minutes which Alaba-
<pb n="5"/>
ma law permits a person to remain in the booth.</p>

<p>In Atlanta census figures show that more than 100,000 Hispanic residents now live in the area. Because Atlanta doesn't provide bilingual ballots, (and the Voting Rights Act does not require it in such places), Spanish speaking voters may not be able to function at the polling booth without assistance.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible disappointment," says Raymond Brown who monitors events surrounding the Voting Rights Act for the Southern Regional Council. "It could be very harmful if it stays in the Act," observed Barbara Phillips, co-director of the Voting Rights Project of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in Washington.</p>

<p>The amended act now faces in the United States Senate an uncertain future. Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina says that the upper chamber will begin considering the Act in early 1982. Thurmond opposes the extension of the preclearance requirements of Section 5 and has said that any Voting Rights Act should apply nationwide. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will be assigned to study HR 3112, Thurmond is in a position to put some clout behind his views.</p>

<p>Orin Hatch, Republican of Utah, is the chairman of the Judiciary's subcommittee on the Constitution-the legislative unit that has held hearings in the Senate on the Act during past renewals. Hatch's position on Section 5 is unclear; however, he does oppose the House bill's amendments that overturn the Supreme Court's 1980 decision in the Bolden case which held that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act required successful litigants to prove a racially discriminatory effect and purpose of any voting practice. The House bill permits lawsuits to prevail if the court finds a voting change or practice as a racially discriminatory "result."</p>

<p>Laughlin McDonald, the director of the Southern Office of the American Civil Liberties Union which has litigated numerous voting cases, says that a showing of intent to discriminate is difficult if not impossible to prove. "It can't be done if intent to discriminate requires a confession of guilt. "</p>

<p>The Utah senator was a powerful opponent on the same issue in Congress last year when a new, stronger fair housing bill was proposed. The bill died in the Senate because supporters of the act could not convince Hatch to permit litigants to prove only the effect9 of racial discrimination in such cases.</p>

<p>Three Southerners other than Thurmond sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee: Republican John P. East of North Carolina and Republican Jeremiah Denton and Democrat Howell Heflin of Alabama. Both East and Denton have also expressed opposition to several sections of the current Act.</p>

<p>With strong Senate opposition to critical parts of the House Bill,
time favors the opponents of the act. The preclearance requirements of
Section 5 expire August 6 of next year if Congress does not renew the
act before then. Hence, the speed with which the Judiciary Committee
and its subcommittee proceeds to hold hearings and report a bill to
the full Senate is important to the supporters of the Act.</p>
<pb n="6"/>

<p>Also, the historical tool of Southern opposition to civil rights legislation in the Senate, the filibuster, will be available to delay passage or to press for substantial changes. Although Senate rules on filibustering have changed since the early 1960s, a two thirds vote of all senators is still required in most instances to halt a filibuster.</p>

<p>The act does have bipartisan sponsorship in the Senate. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts is joined by Democratic Senators Patrick Moynahan of New York, Alan Cranston of California, Howard Metzenbaurn of Wisconsin, and Joseph Biden of Delaware. Republican co-sponsors include Lowell Weicker of Connecticut and Charles Mathias of Maryland.</p>

<p>Also, in an unprompted announcement in June while hearings were being held in the house, Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona released a statement supporting the Act's renewal. Aides for the Senate sponsors also say that they have picked up additional Republican and Democratic support in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Despite added support, some key officials have kept mostly silent about the Act. Senate majority leader Howard Baker of Tennessee and Democratic minority leader Robert Byrd of Virginia-both influential in vote-getting and setting procedural rules-have not made their positions on the act clear. The only Southern Senator with a good record on the Act, (Chart Number 2), Baker supported extension of the Act in 1970 before becoming head of the Senate Republicans. Byrd opposed the extension without some amendments six years ago, saying, "I just think that the South is entitled to some consideration for the efforts it has made over the past ten years to comply with this law."</p>

<p>In mid-October, however, Byrd did head off the possibility that
Thurmond could kill the House bill by never reporting it from
committee. When the bill was received by the Senate, Byrd used a
parliamentary rule to place H.R. 3112 on a special
<pb n="7"/>
calendar which permits the full Senate to call up the bill for debate even if the committee has not reported it. The technique of burying legislation in committee was used often in the late 50s and early 60s by the Senate's Southern chairmen hostile to civil rights legislation.</p>

<p>Baker's position and that of other Republicans may be influenced strongly by the White House's views. In June President Reagan requested Attorney General William French Smith to determine if the Voting Rights Act was the "most appropriate means of guaranteeing" the right to vote. Reagan asked for the report by October 1.</p>

<p>The report apparently arrived at the White House on October 2, although its release was delayed. According to sources who saw the document early, the report presents the President with five options. "All of them could spell disaster for a strong act," remarks one civil rights lawyer who had read the report.</p>

<p>Although the President mentioned early this year his own interest in nationwide coverage for the Act, the Attorney General concludes that "there has not yet been developed a record sufficient to demonstrate such a pervasive disregard for minority voting rights in 'non-covered' jurisdiction to support a nationwide extension of the Act's special provisions." At the same time, the report supports removing some local and state governments from the required preclearance of voting changes.</p>

<p>The three options which the Attorney General stresses would weaken HR 3112 by permitting easier "bailout" of local jurisdictions and requiring a good" record for only five to seven years. The House bill requires a "clean" record for a period of ten years before the jurisdiction can bailout.</p>

<p>One of the alternatives the Attorney General appears to recommend
strongly is a five-year extension with provisions that automatically
permit bailout for jurisdictions with low minority populations or high
minority registration.</p>
<pb n="8"/>

<p>While the President's views on the Act carry weight with many senators, the strong support for the Act in the House probably will not. The voting records of Southern representatives on the Act show that while only 19 of 108 in eleven Southern States voted against final passage of HR 3112, a majority did support most weakening amendments. If Southern senators follow that pattern, the House bill will be out of danger only if weakening amendments fail. Moreover, it is possible that proponents of the Act in the Senate will have to propose floor amendments in order to restore provisions in the House bill which Thurmond's committee may remove.</p>

<p>Many Southern political observers also discount the notion that the region's senators will follow prevailing votes of their state's House delegations. For example, while a majority of North Carolina's congressmen voted in favor of a stronger act on all roll call votes, no one in the state believes that the Republicans Jesse Helms and John East will take their instructions from those votes. Both North Carolina senators are on record opposing major provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>Perhaps South Carolina's Rep. Carroll Campbell foretold the fate of
the Act for the next few months on October 5. After attempting to
amend HR 3112, Campbell voted for final passage but rose immediately
afterwards to explain: "I consider this bill deficient in some
respects and I expect the Senate to consider the merits of the
arguments raised against certain provisions."</p>

<head>The Danger of Retreating from the
Second Reconstruction</head>
<docAuthor>by C. Vann Woodward</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 4, No. 1, 1981, pp. 13-15</docDate>
<argument>
<p>C. Vann Woodward presented this testimony before the House Subcommitee
      on Civil and Constitutional Rights on June 24, 1981.
</p>
<p>My name is C. Vann Woodward, and I am a historian by profession. Although I have taught at Yale University for fifteen years and still live and work there, my main identifications have been with the Southern states. Bom and reared in Arkansas, educated in Georgia and North Carolina, I taught at Georgia Tech, the University of Florida, and the University of Virginia before joining the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University for fifteen years and then moving to Yale in 1962. The main subject of both my teaching and my books (the first of which appeared in 1938) has always been the history of my native region, especially that of the post-Civil War period. In that period, as in my writings about it, the history of race relations has naturally played an important part.
C. Vann Woodward presented this testimony before the House
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights on June 24, 1981.</p>
</argument>
<p>The last forty years have been an exciting time for the historian of race and race relations. Exploring the past, I was continually encountering the present-or something strikingly like it-and living in the present, I was constantly running head-on into the past. I never had any trouble in my teaching and writing with the demand for what students used to call "relevance." The danger was in confusing past with present and committing the offense historians call "presentism." One such danger lay in the tempting comparison between events of the 1860s and 1870s with events of a century later. I must assume responsibility for giving currency to the term "Second Reconstruction" as applied to events of our own time and for encouraging the development of some aspects of the analogy between the First and the Second Reconstruction. The analogy was almost inescapable, given the new confrontation between North and South, between white and black, between federal and state government and the daily evocation of the constitutional amendments, federal laws, government policies, and court decisions of the 1860s and 1870s.</p>

<p>Historical analogies are notoriously dangerous things. I shall spare you a lecture on the differences between the First and Second Reconstruction, but I do believe that there is one experience of the Reconstruction in the previous century that should be of special interest in deliberations regarding changes in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 1 have in mind the fateful decisions of the federal government that climaxed in 1876-1877 and led to the virtual abandonment of federal efforts to enforce the rights of the freedmen in the Southern states. Those rights, including the right to, vote, were guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution and federal laws to enforce them. The winning and guarantee of those rights were essential parts of the justification of the bloodiest war in our history that cost the lives of 600,000 Americans as well as the justification of the struggle for reconstruction that followed. Yet the white electorate, North as well as South, was wearied and disillusioned with the struggle and a majority was ready to give it up. In turning their back on promises, commitments, and principles of long standing, Republicans knew that the honor of their party was at stake.</p>

<p>Before taking the final step and turning over to the Southern
states, and the opposition party that would control them, the defense
of black rights they were abandoning, the Republicans demanded formal
pledges from Southern officials and leaders, guarantees that they
would assure full protection to the rights of blacks, including the
right to vote. All
<pb n="14"/> 
of the Southern states were deeply involved in these negotiations, but Louisiana and South Carolina, for special reasons, took the lead. They were the last two Southern states under Republican government and under the new policy of the Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes, those governments of those states would collapse and be replaced by governments of the opposition. This in spite of the fact that Hayes's election as president depended on the assumption of Republican victory in both states.</p>

<p>Guarantees of protection for black rights were requested of Louisiana a few days before the Compromise of 1877 was consummated and Hayes was inaugurated president. The incoming Governor Francis T. Nicholls promptly wired his spokesman in Washington that a joint caucus of his party's members of both houses had adopted a resolution, "that the guarantees asked for, of order, peace, and protection of law to white and black, no persecution for past political conduct, no immunity for crime, can be freely given." The spokesman forwarded this resolution to representatives of Hayes together with "The Nicholls government guarantee: " as follows:

<q><p>"First. The acceptance of the civil and political equality of all men, and agree not to attempt to deprive the colored people of any political or civil right, privilege, or immunity enjoyed by any class of men.</p>

<p>"Second. The enforcement of the laws rigidly and impartially, to the end that violence and crime shall be suppressed and promptly punished, and that the humblest laborer upon the soil of Louisiana, of either color, shall receive full protection of law in person and property.</p>

<p>"Third. The education of the children of white and black citizens with equal advantages.</p>

<p>"Fourth. The promotion of kindly relations between white and colored citizens of the State, upon a basis of justice and mutual confidence."</p></q></p>

<p>The incoming Governor Wade Hampton of South Carolina also waiting
to take power after the downfall of the state Republican
administration, was already on public record in a pamphlet published
in 1876 entitled, <hi rend="italic">Free Men! Free Ballots!! Free
Schools!!! The Pledges of Gen. Wade Hampton, Democratic Candidate for
Governor to its Colored People of South Carolina,1865-1876.</hi> In
this he promised that, <hi rend="italic">"Not one single right enjoyed
by the colored people today shall be taken from them. They shall be
the equals, under the law, of any man in South Carolina. And we
further pledge that we will give better facilities for education than
they have ever had before. "</hi> And again,"I pledge my faith, and I pledge it for those gentlemen who are on the ticket with me, that if we are elected, as far as in us lies, we will observe, protect, and defend the rights of the colored man as quickly as (of] any man in South Carolina."</p>

<p>Comparable promises for the protection of black rights were forthcoming from other Southern states and continued to appear after federal withdrawal. Two years after the compromise of 1877 was closed three of the South's most prominent leaders, L.Q.C. Lamar, of Mississippi, Alexander Stephens, of Georgia, and Wade Hampton agreed in a public statement that the disfranchisement of blacks was not only impossible but undesired by the whites of the South. Lamar declared that it was "a political impossibility under any circumstances short of revolution," and that even if it were possible the South would not permit it. </p>

<p>Northern Republican white leaders who had supported the Compromise of 1877 professed complete faith in its workability and trust in the pledges from the South. James G. Blaine wrote in 1879, "there will be no attempt made in the Southern States to disfranchise the Negro by any of those methods which would still be within the power of the State. There is no Southern state that would dare venture on an educational qualification [for the franchise], because by the last census there were more than one million white persons over fifteen years of age, who could not read a word.... Nor would the property test operate with any greater advantage to the whites." In Atlanta President Hayes told blacks in his audience that "their rights and interests would be safer if this great mass of intelligent white men were let alone by the general government," safer in fact than if the federal government were still custodian of their rights.</p>

<p>It was not that these Republican leaders were excessively naive nor
blind to political realities that were making a farce of their faith
all around them. Rather they chose to believe what they wanted to
believe, or what was consistent with their policies. Nor was it that
the prominent Southern leaders whose solemn promise I have quoted were
bald faced and unconscionable liars. I realize that I am somewhat more
charitable about the good faith and intentions of these gen-
<pb n="15"/>
try than
some of my students. But I find other explanations more plausible than
the assumption of deliberate falsehood and deception. Actually some of
the Southern conservatives, Hampton and Nicholls for example, made
efforts to fulfill their promises and for a short time enjoyed a
measure of success and white support. But their prestige and
popularity- even that of a Hampton -was no substitute for the power and authority of the federal government. And once that authority, or the will to enforce it, was withdrawn a vacuum of permissiveness expanded that the prestige and influence of no leader could fill. The will of the white majority asserted itself or acquiesced in the face of extremists who set out to destroy black rights utterly at the cost of the popular government and democratic principles.</p>

<p>The farcical nature of the 1878 congressional elections in the South should have made plain the bankruptcy of the Compromise of 1877. Coercion, intimidation, and fraud were the means used in '78, but the more subtle legal devices of attrition to diminish, curtail, and dilute the black votes were quickly developed and imitated. By 1882 Georgia and Virginia had adopted poll taxes and South Carolina had developed the eight-ballot box law. These together with innocent-looking registration and secret-voting laws sharply reduced voting among illiterate and impoverished blacks. Yet a majority of black men continued to vote (or to be counted) in nine of the eleven states through the 80s. It was not until toward the end of the century and the first years of the next that the reactionary revolution, the all-out revolt against democracy was carried out in the South. This resulted in the almost total disfranchisement of blacks, sharp reduction of white voters, reduction of the overall voter turnout by an average of 37 percent (66 percent in Louisiana), the elimination of opposition parties, and the establishment of one-party rule that lasted half a century.</p>

<p>I do not expect so drastic a counterrevolution to end the Second Reconstruction or anything so extreme to result from your decision about the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 1 do think it reasonable, however, to warn that a weakening of that Act, especially the preclearance clause, will open the door to a rush of measures to abridge, diminish, and dilute if not emasculate the power of the black vote in Southern states. Previous testimony has shown how persistent and effective such efforts have been even with the preclearance law in effect. Remove that law and the permissiveness will likely become irresistible-in spite of promises to the contrary. The coming reallocation of congressional seats in the South as a consequence of the 1980 census will open many temptations for manipulation of laws affecting voting. I hope that retreat from the Second Reconstruction will not make it necessary for some future generation to face a Third.</p>

<head>How the Voting Rights Act
is the Most Effective Act on the Books</head>
<docAuthor>By Drew Days</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 4, No. 1, 1981, pp. 16,25-27</docDate>
<argument><p>Drew Days, who testified before Congress on July 13, 1981, is now a professor at Yale Law School.</p></argument>

<p>As one who was charged with enforcing a host of other federal civil rights laws, I can attest that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is by far the most effective statute on the books. While diligent efforts have been made to achieve compliance with laws prohibiting discrimination in housing, education, employment and the like, meaningful remedies for proven violations in these areas have come only after years of litigation. Administration of the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act has, in contrast, prevented in a matter of days electoral changes likely to undercut or retard meaningful minority participation at the ballot box.</p>

<p>It would be unfortunate, however, for anyone to take what I have just said about the relative effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act to mean that over a century of injustice against minority voters has been remedied and that we need no longer fear that new strategies will be devised to reverse or retard what few gains have been achieved since the Act came into existence. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>Though the Act has been on the books since 1965, any fair assessment of its enforcement history would have to conclude that it has been a meaningful weapon against other than the most direct forms of discrimination for less than a decade. It was not until 1969 that the Supreme Court made clear that private parties could sue to obtain compliance by covered jurisdictions with provisions of Section 5 and not until 1971 that the Justice Department received explicit Supreme Court approval to require that changes in polling place locations and in boundary lines by means of annexations receive approval pursuant to Section 5 procedures. Moreover, procedures for enforcing the Voting Rights Act have been the subject of broadly-based court challenges, several of which had to be resolved by the Supreme Court, almost every year since it was enacted.</p>

<p>One must also acknowledge, in assessing the Act's effectiveness,
that covered jurisdictions have made literally hundreds of changes
that have never met the preclearance requirement of Section 5. I do not think it extravagant to conclude that many of those changes probably worked to the serious disadvantage of minority voters. I am proud of the performance of the Civil Rights Division in enforcing the Voting Rights Act during my tenure. But I will not assert that even during what I think was a vigorous enforcement of the Act that the Department was able to ensure that every, or indeed most, electoral changes by covered jurisdictions were subjected to the Section 5 process. There was neither time nor adequate resources to canvas systematically changes since 1965 that had not been precleared, to obtain compliance with such procedures or even, in a few cases, to ascertain whether submitting jurisdictions had complied with objections to proposed changes.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon for us to find out about changes made several
years earlier from a submission made by a covered jurisdiction seeking
preclearance of a more recent enactment. Take, for example, the case
of the City of Greenville, Pitt County, North Carolina. In February
1980, the Department of Justice received a submission from Greenville,
a city with a 25 percent black population, seeking preclearance of
voting changes that became law in 1970, 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1977
without satisfying Section 5 requirements. In this instance, it should
be noted, the submission was prompted by inquiries we made based upon
an FBI survey conducted of voting changes in North Carolina, conducted
at our request. Though the Department found most of the changes were
nondiscriminatory, an objection was lodged to the city's switch from a
plurality to majority vote system for election of its city council
because of its discriminatory consequences for black voters. Viewed
more positively, however, the Greenville experience does point up the
fact that
<pb n="25"/>
many unprecleared changes do come ultimately to the Department's attention. Extension of the Act should increase the likelihood that existing noncompliance with the law will be uncovered and remedied for the betterment of minority voters.</p>

<p>We must also recognize that electoral gains by minorities since 1965 have not taken on such a permanence as to render them immune to attempts by opponents of equality to diminish their political influence. I do not mean to be rhetorical or hyperbolic when I say that electoral victories, won by minorities in many communities through courageous and tenacious effort, could be swept away overnight were protections afforded by the Voting Rights Act removed. Shifts from ward to at-large elections, from plurality win to majority vote, from slating to numbered posts, annexations and changes in the size of electoral bodies, could, in any given community among those jurisdictions covered by the Act, deprive minority voters of fair and effective procedures for electing candidates of their choice. "One swallow does not make a spring" and it is too early to conclude that the effects of decades of discrimination against blacks and other minorities have been eradicated and that they are now in a position to compete in the political arena against nonminorities on an equal basis without the assistance of the Voting Rights Act.</p>

<p>As recently as last month, a three judge district court concluded that in Port Arthur, Texas where blacks constituted 45 percent of the population, city officials proposed redistricting plans subsequent to annexation of virtually all-white suburban areas, "which guaranteed that blacks would remain underrepresented on the City Council by comparison to their numerical strength in the enlarged community."</p>

<p>As Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights from March 1977 to December 1980, it was my responsibility to review, with the assistance of my staff, literally thousands of voting changes subject to the preclearance provisions of the Act, to lodge objections to those changes determined to have a discriminatory purpose or effect, to seek the assistance of the courts in enforcing such objections and to respond to litigation brought by covered jurisdictions challenging our refusal to grant preclearance.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Department of Justice opposition during my tenure to these proposals under the Voting Rights Act, they might well have gone into effect unchallenged.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it bears noting that Voting Rights Act enforcement
still must be concerned with changes that have a direct effect upon the process of casting ballots, even though most of the serious challenges to minority electoral gains have come recently from redistricting and annexations. In April 1978, for example, New Orleans, Louisiana submitted five proposed polling place changes two days <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the changes went into effect for April 1 elections in that jurisdiction. We concluded that one of the changes had had discriminatory effects, in fact, upon the participation of black voters in the election. In that instance, the polling place was changed only 14 days before the election from a private home located in the 92 percent black district to an elementary school in another, noncontiguous district. Advertisements placed in the daily newspaper up to March 30 contained the address of the old polling place. On the day prior to the election itself, the correct polling place location was given but the public school was incorrectly identified. The new polling place, located approximately 16 blocks from the old, required voters, many of whom were elderly, without automobiles or convenient access to public transportation, to cross an interstate highway approximately 170 feet wide in order to cast their ballots. Not unsurprisingly in view of the physical and other obstacles to casting their ballots, many black voters stayed at home on election day.</p>

<p>Between early 1977 and the end of 1980, the Attorney General, on my recommendation, authorized the assignment of over 3,000 federal observers to monitor elections in covered jurisdictions. In almost every case, observers were assigned based upon our judgment that physical interference, intimidation or pressure was likely to be directed at minority voters absent a federal presence. Minority advances in the electoral process would appear to me to be especially vulnerable during the next few years when thousands of jurisdictions will be reapportioning themselves and making other alterations in their political structures based upon results of the 1980 census. I can think of no worse time to pull out from under minorities the props contained in the Voting Rights Act than during this period.</p>

<p>Some opponents of extension of the present preclearance mechanism argue that if the requirements of Section 5 are continued, then they should apply nationwide. As I understand it, these people argue that for 17 years the South has been in what they call "a penalty box," and the time has come either to remove the preclearance stigma that was designed to punish the South for its past discriminatory conduct or to make all jurisdictions across the country subject to the same preclearance requirements.</p>

<p>There are several basic misperceptions behind calls for nationwide
coverage. First, the preclearance provisions of Section 5 were not
designed to punish anyone but were instead, in the wisdom of Congress,
an effort to protect the. voting rights of a previously
disenfranchised minority. The triggering formula for preclearance
automatically applies to parts of 22 states which employed a literacy
test and where less than 50 percent of the voting age residents were
registered or had voted in certain presidential elections. The trigger
for coverage addresses a problem of substantial under representation
and under participation of minority citizens where that problem
exists, and is not per se regionally biased. No states or other
jurisdictions which are covered are named in the Act. Some Southern
states, such as Tennessee and Arkansas, are not covered by Section
5. In contrast, three
<pb n="26"/>
counties in New York City, Monterey, California and El Paso, Colorado are a few examples of covered jurisdictions outside the South.</p>

<p>Perhaps those who argue for nationwide coverage do not understand that -the Act already contains a section allowing a court to order preclearance in a state or political subdivision not presently covered by the triggering formula. Under Section 3(c), if a federal district court makes a finding of Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment violations, it may order preclearance with the Attorney General or the local district court of voting law changes. Section 3(c) can successfully reach patterns and practices of voting rights violations through case by case litigation in those jurisdictions where the facts suggest there is a need for remedial action to cover voting law changes.</p>

<p>Finally, there are serious administrative problems with nationwide preclearance. It is hard enough for the Department of Justice to enforce the present provisions with respect to existing covered jurisdictions. In many ways the Department relies on voluntary compliance to enforce Section 5. As far as I know, the Attorney General still has not divined a way to ferret out, all changes that covered jurisdictions make but fail to submit. I can think of no way for the Attorney General even to begin to get notice of all affected changes if nationwide preclearance is adopted. Although parts of 22 states are already covered, nationwide coverage would require justice Department review of the laws of 41 states not now covered and of tens of thousands more political subdivisions.</p>

<p>While a dozen Civil Rights Division employees presently review all submissions from covered jurisdictions, the staff would be inundated by the avalanche of voting change submissions from every state, county, and city in the country. Keep in mind, that Section 5 requires that the Department of Justice look at each of these submissions within 60 days.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the Department of Justice is studying a
proposal to restrict the types of voting changes subject to
preclearance re-
<pb n="27"/>
view. One possibility under review would be to limit the preclearance requirement to those types of changes that have elicited the most objections from the justice Department. I don not endorse this effort.</p>

<p>Clearly some changes have a greater impact than others. I would agree that the discriminatory redistricting of a state or the annexation of territory by a city which is already using an at-large method of election might affect adversely the minority population in the entire jurisdiction. On the other hand, changes in polling place locations from a housing project in the minority community to a distant location across town, as with a New Orleans submission, may have precisely the type of discriminatory consequences Congress sought to prevent, even though the number of people adversely affected may be smaller. And there are polling place changes which substantially and adversely affect the entire minority community. Recently, the Department of justice objected to a polling place change that illustrates very well my point. The Board of Directors of the Burleson County Hospital District, Texas, reduced the number of polling places to be used in the hospital district election for board of directors from 13 to one, eliminating the polling places in the predominantly Mexican American and black communities. The one remaining polling place was 19 miles from the Mexican American community and 30 miles from the black community. Without Section 5, this polling place change, which was not submitted until the justice Department wrote to the district, would have had a substantial discriminatory effect since the hospital district has significant taxing powers. I, for one, am not prepared to say that polling place changes no longer hurt.</p>

<p>The lesson of the pre 1965 experience is that jurisdictions did not limit their efforts to discriminate to one type of voting practice. Congress determined that a preclearance mechanism that monitored all perspective voting changes was necessary to reach and correct discriminatory practices that kept cropping up to replace schemes that had been successfully challenged.</p>

<hi rend="bold">Bail-Out</hi>

<p>I am aware that one of the topics being discussed most is the procedure for "bailing-out," that is, for terminating Section 5 coverage for a covered jurisdiction. There is a bail-out provision in the law as it stands, and it has always been there. Moreover, that bail-out procedure, in Section 4(a), has been used successfully by 24 jurisdictions since 1975.</p>

<p>The current bail-out allows Jurisdictions with a genuine history of nondiscrimination to bail-out. Because there is a bail-out that works in the law as it stands, Congress should think very hard before deciding to change the procedure and venture out into uncharted territory. Bail-out is a complicated subject that should be complicated further by change only if the record requires it.</p>

<p>I would suggest several major areas of caution about an alternative bail-out. First, there should be a stringent showing, over a significant period of time, of no violations of the Voting Rights Act or of the Constitution or other voting rights provisions, as well as no objections to proposed voting changes. In the category of no violations, I put a high value on a record of no implementation of Section 5 changes by the jurisdiction in question without submission and preclearance. During the past 5 years, there have been an alarmingly high number of nonsubmissions throughout the covered jurisdictions; these should not be tolerated in a jurisdiction seeking to show that it is 11 pure" or "saintly" and, therefore, entitled to bail-out.</p>

<p>Second, any bail-out formula should require a showing that the jurisdiction has taken affirmative steps to bring about full voting participation, and the steps to be taken should be an incentive, it ought to set standards high enough to discourage a jurisdiction that might want to be free of the submission obligation but not wish to undergo a true change of attitude and practice.</p>

<p>Third, there should be some measure of the practical effect of the things that the jurisdiction sets out to do, such as a significant increase in the rate of participation by minority voters, and, perhaps other measures.</p>

<p>Apart from the substantive showing to be made by a jurisdiction on seeking to bail-out, there ought to be some careful attention to the procedural and jurisdictional details. For one thing, the standards ought to be as well-defined as possible. The current standards are well-defined, and this clarity has been useful to many local attorneys in deciding whether to bring a bail-out suit. Vague or subjective standards would be very unhelpful.</p>

<p>Next, a jurisdiction seeking to bailout should have to establish not only that its record as a particular governmental body warrants Section 5 coverage termination, but that the same is true of all subunits of government located there. For example, it would not be sensible to allow a state to bail-out if there were violations within individual counties and cities within the state.</p>

<p>Congress recognized that every attack on the right to vote kills at least a part of it that can never be brought back-especially for minority citizens who have been bred to know that some people will stop at literally nothing to prevent them from having that right. Extension of the Voting Rights Act offers the only genuine prospect for ensuring that millions of minority citizens gain their rightful place in the political fife of this Nation. The Act's preclearance provisions do not need to be amended or altered; the Act just needs the resources and vigilant oversight only this Congress can provide to ensure its continued effectiveness. Finally, Congress must ensure that the current and all future Administrations faithfully enforce the provisions of this most vital law.</p>

<head>Barriers to Voter Registration
Remain Southwide</head>
<docAuthor>By Raymond Brown</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 4, No. 1, 1981, pp. 34-35</docDate>
<argument>
<p>Raymond Brown testified before Congress on June 16, 1981.</p>

<p>My name is Raymond Brown, I am director of a special project of the Southern 
Regional Council that is examining voting rights in the South.</p>
</argument>

<p>Since the end of the white primary system in the South, the most
basic indication of the fulfillment of the right to register and vote
has been the analysis of registration by race. Once the Supreme Court
had dismantled the legal mechanisms by which blacks were excluded from
the electoral process, white resistance intensified at the courthouses
where blacks could register to vote. As the venerable V.0. Key, Jr.,
said in his panoramic work <hi rend="italic">Southern Politics</hi>, each local registration officer became a law unto himself in determining the citizens' right to vote, and the machinery of registration in the hands of resisting white officials became the most evasive and effective method of denying the franchise.</p>

<p>Of course, the 1965 Voting Rights Act recognized this basic problem and provided for the appointment of federal registrars and a preclearance of voting changes in order to overcome the local, rooted efforts of resistance. After 15 years, the mechanics of the Voting Rights Act have improved the status of black's right to vote, and the percentages of registered blacks have increased dramatically since 1965. For example, since 1962 the number of black registered voters has almost tripled in the 11 Southern states.</p>

<p>It would be a tragic mistake, however, to assume that the right to register and vote has been accomplished in most areas of the South. Resistance continues to be widespread. Among 182 counties and parishes with more than 20 percent black population in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, only four counties have a rate of registered blacks among the black population greater than the white rate of registration.</p>

<p>In Georgia differences were extraordinary in a large number of counties. In Wilkins County, Georgia, where 45.9 percent of the population is black, the white rate of registration is 85.7 percent and the black rate of registration is 54.4 percent. In Miller County, Georgia where there is a 28 percent black population, the difference between the black and white rate of registration is 32.8 percentage points.</p>

<p>With the rarest exception, the rate of white registration continues to exceed, by a substantial margin, the rate of black registration throughout the Deep South. In the four states surveyed, the average rate of black registration is approximately 14 percentage points below the average rate of white registration. The differences in the rate of registration between blacks and whites in Georgia is 16.6 percent; In North Carolina it is 16.5 percent; in South Carolina it is 16.7 percent; and in Louisiana it is almost 20 percent.</p>

<p>Some state officials in the South argue that there are now many counties "Where voter participation problems are far fewer than in the past and ..., demographically, do not justify the use of preclearance procedures." As an example, these officials have usually pointed to those Southern counties without significant black populations as the areas within the South where black's problems with political participation no longer exist.</p>

<p>On the most basic measurement of political participation, the Council's analysis of selected jurisdictions without large black populations in these four Southern states belies the contention that the right to register and vote has become the equal right of both black and white citizens. In a representative group of 36 counties in Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, where the black population was below 20 percent of the jurisdiction, the Council analyzed registration data. The black population of these counties ranged from 2 percent in Cherokee County, North Carolina, to 19 percent in Cherokee County, South Carolina. By geography and population they constitute a representative sample of the Southern counties with little black population.</p>

<p>In these 36 counties, no jurisdiction has a rate of black registration equal the rate of white registration. In most of these counties the difference between the higher white rate and the lower black rate is comparable to the differences among the heavily populated counties. In Allegheny County, North Carolina, for example, where less than 2 percent of the population is black, the rate of registration among the white population exceeds the rate of registration among blacks by a difference of 20.2 percentage points-a difference that exceeds the average in North Carolina among the heavily black populated counties.</p>

<p>In Louisiana, La Salle parish has only a 9 percent black population, but the rate of registration among whites exceeds the rate of registration among blacks by more than 10 percentage points. Gwinnett County, Georgia also shows a particularly egregious example of depressed black registration. In this suburban Atlanta county where only 2 percent of the population is black, the rate of registration among that 2 percent is almost 18 percentage points below the rate of registration among the 98 percent white population. And in Henry County, the 17 percent black population has a registration rate that is more than 34 percentage points below the white rate.</p>

<p>Perhaps most remarkably, in almost half of these counties with less than 20 percent black population (15 of 36) the difference between the white and black rate of registration is greater than the average difference in the substantially black populated counties of the applicable state. In other words, by traditional indicators, the problems of registration in counties with smaller black populations in the Deep South continue to be as great as the problems of registrations in largely black populated counties.</p>

<p>Registration data offers us some important observations:</p>

<p>1. The differences between the rate of registration among blacks and whites continues to be substantial and widespread;</p>

<p>2. The differences between rates of black and white registration, and probably the problems which accompany such substantial differences, exist in those areas of the South where the black population is not substantial as much as it does where the black population is 20 percent or more;</p>

<p>3. The improvement in registration has continued over the past 23 years although the rate of improvement has slackened since 1966.</p>

<p>The analysis clearly indicates that none of the white elected
officials who are in positions to influence state election procedures,
in terms of ensuring that they are equitable, has "confessed religion
and been baptized. " Rather the data show that the "mourners' " bench
is still filled with sinners and the revival must continue."</p>

<head>"Section 5 and Voting Changes:The Heart of the Act</head>
<docAuthor>By Vernon E. Jordan and Lane Kirkland</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 4, No. 1, 1981, pp. 36-37</docDate>
<argument>
<p>Vernon Jordan testified before Congress on the Voting Rights Acton May 6,1981.</p>

<p>I am Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., President of the National Urban League,
Inc. The National Urban League is a 70-year old non-profit
community-service organization which has historically been concerned
with seeking equal opportunities for all Americans in all sectors of
our society.</p>

<p>Lane Kirkland is the president of the national AFL-CIO. A native of South Carolina, Kirkland testified before Congress on May 6, 1981.</p>
</argument>
<p><hi rend="bold">Vernon E. Jordan</hi></p>

<p>Having been born and reared in Atlanta, Georgia, as a Southerner I know personally that no right in all the Constitution's arsenal is more basic than the right to vote. I know how indispensable that right has been in including blacks in the democratic process from which historically we have been excluded. The right to vote has been directly related to our economic growth and the sense of self worth and dignity that blacks are beginning to gain in this country.</p>

<p>In the 60s I was director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council. As director, I had first hand experience of how absolutely essential to Southern reform the Voting Rights Act was and must continue to be.</p>

<p>The Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were great and rare affirmations of equality. There is more, much more to be done before equality that Americans have dreamed about is achieved. Those of us engaged in the struggle for equal rights and equal opportunity know all too well that the gains made by black Americans have been modest and indeed fragile. But if these times are not propitious for moving ahead, let them not be ripe for moving backward.</p>

<p>Section 5, which has become the critical focus of the Act during the last decade, was enacted pursuant to Congress' power under the 15th Amendment to legislate protections against voting discrimination. This preclearance provision requires that any new changes in voting or election procedures initiated by "covered jurisdictions" must be approved or precleared by the Justice Department of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. It appropriately places the burden on heretofore recalcitrant jurisdictions by requiring that new changes not be discriminatory in purpose or in effect. It specifically protects blacks and language minorities in regions where their voting interests have been quelled.</p>

<p>Section 5 was enacted only after a century of near futile litigation in which constitutional arguments failed to curtail adequately discriminatory electoral procedures. It was enacted only upon Congress' long awaited recognition of the fact that disenfranchisement takes many innovative forms. It came only after other civil rights legislation was cleverly skirted or ignored and blacks and other minorities still largely remained outsiders to the political process.</p>

<p>Today diminution and dilution of existing voting patterns and practices must be avoided at all costs. We must be vigilant and ever-mindful of sophisticated procedural devices and schemes which effectively nullify equitable access to the electoral process. What we currently face are 1980 versions of the pre-1965 poll tax and literacy requirements.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, for example, the number of enactments concerning voting changes for all 100 counties from 1925 to 1940 number only half of the amount of voting changes enacted since 1965. And those 193 enactment's identified since the passage of the Voting Rights Act pertain only to the 39 North Carolina counties covered by Section 5 as compared to the 100 counties concerned during disenfranchisement.</p>

<p>Section 5, however, is not, by any means, limited to Southern states. It in fact applies to all or part of 23 states including Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii and parts of New England, spanning the four comers of this nation.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, in New York, three covered counties-King, Bronx and Manhattan-together encompass a larger population than any single Southern state.</p>

<p>History has taught us that nothing short of Section 5's requirement that a newly drafted electoral scheme have a non-discriminatory purpose or effect can insure the protection guaranteed by the 15th Amendment.</p>

<p>As to the administrative burden on submitting jurisdictions, the Act requires only correspondence by mail or phone while guaranteeing a decision from the Attorney General in 60 days. In our view, such a requirement is not unduly burdensome in light of the potential voting discrimination prevented and the thousands of voters affected by each Section 5 objection.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to differentiate between reasons why the votes of
blacks and other minorities are short-changed or diluted: one reason
is patently as bad as another. It may be nearly impossible to get
inside the heads of John Doe or Richard Roe and pick out specific
intent for specific acts. But it is not difficult to see the social
intent which lies behind and expresses itself in political structures
and processes which hold back what the Supreme Court once called
"discrete and insular minorities." Indeed, it is hard to avoid seeing
it; only the singularly willful can manage to do so.</p><pb n="37"/>

<p>Since the passage of the Voting Rights Act we have witnessed significant increases in black voter registration as well as black elected officials. The abolition of the poll tax, the presence of federal examiners, the ban of literacy tests and objections to racial gerrymandering have allowed black voter registration to climb to over 3.5 million and the election of over 2,000 black officials in Southern states.</p>

<p>But we also witness continuing plans to keep the black vote impotent. Since 1975, the Justice Department has filed over 5,060 Section 5 objections to discriminatory electoral systems.</p>

<p>Seventeen years is not enough time to undo the ropes with which America's minorities have for centuries been bound into powerlessness. The minorities of this country have an inalienable right to expect nothing less than fair and equal participation in the political process. Nothing short of the renewal of the Voting Rights Act will satisfy that right.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Lane Kirkland</hi></p>

<p>It is not surprising then that there is near universal agreement that the Voting Rights Act has been the most successful of this country's civil rights laws.</p>

<p>Blacks and the language minorities protected by the bilingual provisions are now participating in political life in greatly increased numbers, both as voters and as candidates.</p>

<p>But that relative success does not mean that our nation has reached a state of grace. How much remains to be done is evident from the statistics alone: Section 5 has been in force for 15 years.</p>

<p>Pursuant to its requirements that covered jurisdictions clear with either the attorney general or the federal courts every proposed change in voting laws or practices, more than 800 such proposals have been rejected.</p>

<p>Even if we assume that in some instances the discriminatory effect was inadvertent, it is evident that there remains a solid determination in some quarters to block equality of voting rights.</p>

<p>Indeed, in one state-Mississippi since 1975, there have been as many Section 5 Attorney General objections to proposed discriminatory changes in voting laws as there were in the previous 10 years of the Act's existence.</p>

<p>Statistics, of course, are only a lifeless summary of a living reality. Numbers cannot gauge the depth and range of emotion-the will for power, the fear of those who are different, the racial class and cultural antagonism-expressed in laws restricting the right to participate in political life.</p>

<p>How can numbers measure the effects of 95 years of exclusion from the right to vote and the right to run for office, of 15 years of effective remedial action, or of an abrupt end to that effective remedy?</p>

<p>But those numbers, as well as common sense, are sufficient to warn us that we are discussing today's problem, not yesterday's, and that it is far more likely than not that to end or weaken this law is to end or to weaken the civil rights of the blacks and language minorities the law now protects.</p>

<p>How, then, should Congress approach the question of continuing or abandoning the Act? We believe the Act itself provides the answer.</p>

<p>Section 5 places the burden on the submitting jurisdiction to show that its proposed change "does not have the purpose and will not have the effect" of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color or membership in a language minority.</p>

<p>Under this provision, those whose laws and practices have discriminated in the past must demonstrate that they do so no longer.</p>

<p>We suggest that Section 5 provides a fair and reasonable principle to apply in the present debate. We submit the burden should be put on those who would limit or repeal the Act to prove their case.</p>

<p>Let them demonstrate that the legacy of nearly a century of rights ignored has been wholly overcome, that the lessons of 1870-1965 concerning the inadequacy of the right to sue after a change in voting laws no longer applies, and that these few years of adequate response by the federal government have brought about such a total change of heart that such a response is no longer needed.</p>

<p>Or, if they seek changes under the soft euphemism of perfecting amendments, let them demonstrate that their proposal provides stronger safeguards for civil rights than the present system.</p>

<p>We do not believe that the opponents of the Act are able to carry
this burden, but we deeply believe that it is theirs to carry.</p>

<head>"Extend the Protections of the Act"></head>
<docAuthor>By Edward Kennedy</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 4, No. 1, 1981, pp. 40</docDate>
<argument>
<p>Senator Edward Kennedy spoke on the Senate floor after the
introduction of the bill to renew the Voting Rights Act on April 6,
1981.</p></argument>

<p>I am very pleased to join with Senators Mathias, Biden, Chafee, and Metzenbaum today in introducing the Voting Rights Amendments of 1981. Our bill will extend the essential protections of the historic Voting Rights Act. It will ensure that the hard won progress of the past is preserved, and that the effort to achieve full participation for all Americans in our democracy will continue in the future.</p>

<p>Twice before, in 1970 and 1975, the crucial provisions of the Act have been extended. Each time the Act has come under attack. But each time, the Congress on a bipartisan basis, has come to its rescue, with the support of Americans from every part of the country. And in 1975, the Act's protection was also extended to Hispanic Americans and other language minorities, who have been the victim of similar discrimination in the right to vote.</p>

<p>Now this landmark legislation is again imperiled. The most successful modem civil rights law is in danger of falling victim to its own success. Unless we act, its crucial safeguards will no longer protect those who have relied upon them the most.</p>

<p>In the coming debate, we will hear once more the arguments against the Act that we have heard in the past. We will be told it is a drastic departure from the principles of our federal system. But the Supreme Court has agreed that Congress was faced with a drastic situation and that the law contains reasonable remedies that are fast, efficient and effective.</p>

<p>We will be told that the special provisions are no longer justified, because so much progress has been made. But the gains in registration and the impressive elections of minority officials have often been the direct result of the protections of the Act. We have come a long way since 1965. But our task is not finished. Continued progress toward equal opportunity in the electoral process will be halted if we abandon the Act's crucial safeguards now.</p>

<p>I am concerned about the need for further progress. But I am even more concerned about the risk of losing what has already been won. Those who fought the battles know how fragile the victories are. Without the preclearance of the new laws, many of the advances of the past decade could be wiped out overnight with new schemes and devices.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a steady number of objections under Section 5. In fact, while more than 800 proposed changes have been objected to since 1965, well over half of those objections have been entered since the Act was last extended in 1975.</p>

<p>We will also be told that the Act should be applied across the nation, and that it is wrong to use a double standard against one section of the country. That is simply incorrect. The general provisions -of the Act do operate in every state. Even the special coverage under the trigger formula of Section 4 is not regional. It now applies to all or parts of some 25 different states throughout the country. The preclearance provisions of Section 5 apply literally to the four corners of the nation: from counties in Hawaii and Alaska to parts of New York and several New England states; from Arizona to the Deep South. Of course the major impact has been in the South. But submissions under Section 5 have been required from many other parts of the country.</p>
