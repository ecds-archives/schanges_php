A New Magazine: Our Creed and Hopes</head>
<docAuthor>By Steve Suitts</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol.1 No. 1, 1978, pp. 2-3</docDate>

<p>This first issue of <hi rend="bold">Southern Changes</hi> is nothing new.</p>

<p>On four prior occasions during the last 34 years, the Southern
Regional Council has announced the premiere of a new publication. Each
has differed: one endured for 27 years and another did not live to
celebrate an anniversary. All attempted to mark a new and distinct
emphasis within the organization and a revived hope in the South's
future.</p>

<p>The publications' names show, perhaps, the changing perception of
the region by an organization born in the days when segregation of the
races was fact enforced by law. The <hi rend="bold" >Southern
Frontier</hi> was the Council's first publication and lasted for two
years. Then, in 1946, it was revised in title and format as the <hi rend="bold">New South</hi>.</p>

<p>"The change lies in this," the first edition of<hi rend="bold"> New South</hi>, stated,
"that SRC will from now on strive to study and solve the problems
implicit in (our) goals as parts - symptoms, if you like - of the
overall problem of the South, which is the region's need to develop a
fuller use of its resources, both natural and human, to achieve a
healthy balance between the agriculture and industry within the
region. The democratic corollary to this, of course, lies in the duty
of every Southerner to see to it that such development, as it is
achieved, is used wisely and shared fairly by all, for all. It is to
this development and the democratic shaping of the South's growth that
SRC will give most of its effort." The magazine urged its readers to
join in the task of making the "New South" a reality.</p>

<p>From 1946 until 1974, the magazine's contributors wrote about the
South with sympathy and outrage. They illuminated the obvious and
obscure problems, pled with and cajoled Southerners to do better - to
help bring social change.</p>

<p>Harold Fleming, a former director of the Council and one of the old
hands at <hi rend="bold">New South</hi>, reflected in its final issue that "to be honest,
 <hi rend="bold">New South</hi> helped create the image of Southern readiness for change
that somewhat exceeded the realities of the day." Nonetheless, the <hi rend="bold">New
South</hi> found hope when it was scarce and marshaled an intellectual
force which often plain facts could only bring.</p>

<p>It was just four springtimes ago when <hi rend="bold">New South</hi> and its companion tabloid, since 1970,<hi rend="bold">South Today</hi>, were merged into a new, colorful, and glossy magazine, <hi rend="bold">Southern Voices</hi>. Although its editor observed that "there is even a Southern feel to the universe, suggesting that perhaps the stars are ironically right for this unprecedented venture," it was not to be. After ten months, financial problems silenced <hi rend="bold">Southern Voices</hi>.</p>

<p>During its short life, the magazine marked a change in perception. It was a time, the Council decided, when Southerners of all persuasions could speak to one another about problems and solutions - a time when the entire collected expressions of the South reporting, poetry, fiction, art, photography -could be reproduced in one medium for all to see.</p>

<p>With the echoes of <hi rend="bold">Southern Voices</hi> still an influence today, we commence another publication. It too, has a new name and is the product of that mysterious process of "vision and revision," influenced by the traditions, virtues, and the failures of those who came before. Compared to <hi rend="bold">Southern Voices</hi>, this magazine is a modest undertaking. It has no color, no departments for art, fiction, or poetry.</p>

<p>The magazine will not attempt to attract every Southerner with the general, diverse expressions of Southern life and culture. Its appearance is different and the texture of its paper and its content feel different.</p>

<p>Hopefully, <hi rend="bold">Southern Changes</hi> will have the
riches of analysis, investigation, reporting, interviews,
story-telling, and commentary. The magazine will mainly be a forum for
reliable, concise reporting and interpretation on the issues and
events of the South, with emphasis on the plight of the poor and the
Black Southerners who, along with others, still seek a just
settlement. It will attempt to review the moods, events, developments,
and inactivities of the region. It will have little of the virtues and
the sins of doctrinaire propaganda. It will attempt to show what is
good and decent and hopeful about Southerners and their place. It will
highlight the accomplishments of Southerners and the events of today
and measure how far we have come in our march with the aspirations and
ghosts of yesterday.</p>

<p>It will be called <hi rend="bold">Southern Changes</hi>.</p>

<p>With only slight exaggeration, no single word has infiltrated the
conversations of Southerners on the porches, in streets, or at
statehouses more than the word "change." For more than a century, it
has been the inspiration of Black Southerners; for most of the
Council's existence, the hope of all liberal White and Black
Southerners. It stirred the dreams and thoughts of some leaders and
for others threatened the institutions and traditions they lived
by. The prospects of change mothered racial tensions since folks, whom
academicians called "change agents," would not let it come in the by
and by. The time for change was now.</p>

<p>Until the past few years, it was mostly the Southern liberals who wanted change to come rapidly. All others wanted none, thank you m'aam. Not so anymore, it seems.</p>

<p>Nowadays, many folk who once promoted race-mixing want to slow down
some of the changes going on in our region. Poets wryly speak of
losing our "distinctive Southern character." Some writers yearn for
the days before air conditioning when Southerners would sit and talk
to one another. Others think we have gone far enough. Activists, who
once marched to the hymns of "We Shall Overcome" and hummed the
popular tune about "the times they are 'a changin'," now petition to
stop the construction of super highways or nuclear plants.</p>

<p>However, not a few of those Southerners who never quite mastered
the pronunciation of the word Negro now proudly boast that the South
is changing. Industry, growth, money, skyscraper- they all dance in
the minds of these and many others who have taken up the
uncharacteristically Southern habit of judging success by a balance
sheet. Perhaps, even the region's identity is under change.</p>

<p>The South as a marked region is losing currency. The geography of
the South has been enmeshed with a territory larger and more
amorphous-the Sunbelt. It goes from the East Coast to Southern
California. Some say it is a state of mind as well as place. When
journalists, planners, and businessmen speak of our future, it is the
Sunbelt, not the South which usually holds their attention.

While some of us will not quickly cotton to the self-identity of a
"sunbelter," the changes which are spreading across the South must be
reckoned with. The prospects of a better income which sometimes comes
with economic development can't be shooed away by the
<pb n="3"/>
 poet's turn of a
phrase nor should it be dismissed necessarily as an attack upon our
Southern way of life. In a region where 40% of the nation's poor live,
the promise of a decent income ought not be shunned. And it ought not
be a hoax.</p>

<p>Amid the growth and changing nature of the South, there also
remains too much unchanged. Life in the South for too many Blacks and
poor is still as it was. Low pay, no pay, poor housing, no jobs, try
again next week, they don't work because of welfare (a grand total of
$2,800 each year for a family of four in Mississippi), high infant
death rates, dirt roads, impure water- the chant of conditions and
attitudes continues to stir the cycle of poverty and
discrimination. Also, other minorities and many women are denied
opportunities which national goals should guarantee to all.</p>

<p>With and without the changes, clarity of purpose and unity of
vision are rare commodities in our times. Events and developments seem
duplicitous with promise on one side and failure on the other; the
complexity of social issues and the failures of government to live up
to its goals confuse us all. We live in a South where we must now
select carefully the changes which we invite and the ones which we
oppose. Hence, the subtitle, "a chronicle of the ongoing struggle for
equality."</p>

<p>This publication will attempt to help us all understand the region
we know as the South and ourselves, our neighbors, and the forces
which influence our lives. In doing so, <hi rend="bold">Southern
Changes</hi> claims a new creed which borrows heavily from those
original thoughts of the 1940's. If all else seems questionable, the
major concern for Southerners at home and abroad today is how will our
region change. We hope that this magazine and the Council, jointly and
separately, will help us know the question and the answers a little
better.</p>

<p>As a publication which will go mostly to individuals who are
associate members of the Council, <hi rend="bold">Southern
Changes</hi> will be read by a community of people in and outside the
region who know that the futures of the South and the country have
always, and will always, be tied mysteriously into one fate. It
possesses the adversarial and cooperative; the patriotic, loyal, and
heretical - the opposing qualities which make living in the South
exciting and worrisome.</p>

<p>If nothing else, <hi rend="bold">Southern Changes</hi> will try to
keep us all from masking our uncertainty with nostalgia or blind faith
in the future's holdings. We will try to understand ourselves and our
region and our country. We will try to muster a sense of purpose and
recognize accomplishments and failures in ourselves and our region's
work. It is a task which for all Southerners is as old as our history
and for the Council as dated as its first publication.</p>
<p> Let us journey together.</p>

      Another Political Year" type="Article">
<head>The Burden of the South and Nation In
      Another Political Year</head>
<docAuthor>By Steve Suitts</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 1 No. 1, 1978 pp. 5-6 </docDate>

<p>Southern politics has seldom offered an opportunity for hope or joy to the agitating Southerner. For those of us who bel eve that race and equality have not surrendered their central place in the life of the South, the scars and terrors of past political defeats have made us reluctantly more the observant than the participant. Perhaps, it has sharpened our ability to see clearly. Or, like the neighborhood wag sharing the tales of some highway accident, it may be that we've come to be satisfied with describing politics instead of engaging it.</p>

<p>Yet, this year of all years brings a hope for some Southern liberals that the nature of politics is changing, that the politicians' views have improved, and that the nature of our problems has changed. As proof, it is noted that some of the most skillful masters of the old school of Southern politics are passing away from their places of political eminence. John McClellan of Arkansas, James Eastland of Mississippi, John Sparkman and Jim Allen of Alabama: none will sit in the U.S. Senate in 1979. Indeed, we are reminded that there has been no other year in the past twenty in which so many of the partricians of Southern heritage have relinquished their places.</p>

<p>A little more memory may also tell us, however, that there have
been countless numbers of days when we've tried to find major societal
movements in our politics overnight, and only a few of them have
sustained a lasting, progressive influence Remember when some were
excited that Southerners stuck with Roosevelt through three
administrations as Democrats and then it all fell apart as they walked
out as Dixiecrats on Truman and the civil rights plank. Remember the
hope when John Kennedy carried much of the region in 1960 and the
despair when Barry Goldwater did it in 1964 and Richard Nixon in 1968
and again in 1972? There was a moment of euphoria the night Terry
Sanford became  Governor of North Carolina in the early 1960's and more than a moment of sadness when Jessie Helms went to the Senate from the same state in 1972.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Political Symbols</hi></p>

<p>In observing the present changes in the Senate, we must also recognize the limits of political symbols. Despite our excitement and enthusiasm during a campaign, Southerners have always known that politics carries a duplicity -not always intentional, but apparently inevitable. Thus, we must realize campaign symbols for what they are and are not.</p>

<p>When Governor Bill Finch kissed a Black baby in Mississippi in his
race for the US. Senate, we know that an old social custom had been
broken. But, we don't yet know from that gesture how much Finch cares
about the interests of 'poor Blacks or even what he'll do on
legislation for poor children. And his campaign didn't tell, at least
publicly. After Alabama State Representative John Baker, seeking a
seat in the U.S. Senate, attacked George Wallace for his 1963 stand in the schoolhouse door in a political telecast, we were assured that Baker, if elected, would not make a fool of himself this fall when Blacks register at the University of Alabama. But, we really have not been told anything about how a Senator Baker would vote on legislative proposals to desegregate the University of Alabama and other state schools.</p>

<p>Obviously, the art of political speech to say nothing and to say something at the same time doesn't always have a Southern trademark. Still, our campaigners have commanded the technique so long and so well that we ought to resist on principle, as well as experience, the temptation to gauge the progress of our times by the symbols and illustrations of our political campaigns.</p>

<p>Lest we be overcome by me temptation to say that this year is the exception, we ought to remember also that each of the men who leave the U.S. Senate did survive all major political challenges in their careers and most likely would have done so once again if they had stood for reelection.</p>

<p>If we can't learn from politics much detail about ourselves,
perhaps we should look at the deeds of those already elected and the opinions of those who elect them to know how well we stand. And here, I am no more encouraged than I was on those late summer nights when I stared in disbelief at the election returns which crushed my hopes and my candidates for that year.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">The State of Equality</hi></p>

<p>For my view, there appears no question that the day-to-day support
for the campaign to achieve equality in the South and the nation is
more diminished today than at any other time in the past ten years. While freedom from irrational discrimination has been embraced by our laws and popular opinion, the means to achieve equality have not.</p>

<p>To be sure, past work in the South and elsewhere has moved an entire segment of people out of the bondage of constant fear, intimidation, and humiliation. No longer can Blacks as a whole be dispossessed of property, life, and culture by sham laws and capricious hatred. The law of the land and its enforcement do not prohibit that massive denial for most and offer individual protection for some. And importantly, the work of the past couple of decades for civil rights has inspired a renewed attempt by many other groups in society to strive for their own equal treatment.</p>

<p>Yet, as historian C. Vann Woodward reminded us ten years ago,
"equality (is) a far more revolutionary aim than freedom..."  The
attainment of this goal does not always invoke blatant hatred and
<pb n="6"/>
outrageous open cruelty. Instead, the work to achieve equality often involves the relationship of everyone in almost every corner of their lives. Perhaps for this reason, It is a difficult achievement and remains largely unachieved in Southern and national life today.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Promises Unkept</hi></p>

<p>Of the more than ten million Blacks who live in the South today, about seven million live in counties where more than 20% of the population is Black. Yet, not more than two out of ten of these communities has had a Black elected official in the last 100 years. There remains almost 40 counties and three times as many towns in the rural South where Blacks represent a majority of the population but have never had a Black elected official. The obstacles to full, effective voting and candidacy by Blacks exist in the large part because of continued local resistance by government officials and the growing disinterest of the federal courts.</p>

<p>A recent survey of the employment practices of 16 Southern cities
shows the continuance of a massive pattern of discrimination against
Blacks and women. The results are shocking: almost three fourths of all Black males continued to work for the Southern cities in garage and maintenance. While nine out of ten of all the high-salary positions are held by White males, none of the cities has a Black female making $13,000 or more.</p>

<p>Another report recently revealed that in the last reported fiscal year, the Southern states refused to participate fully in federal programs offering social services to the poor. In a region where welfare is viewed mostly as a handout to the Black poor (a perception that ignores the fact that more Whites in the South are poor than Blacks) and where we have the largest number of poor in the nation, the 11 states of the Old Confederacy failed to spend more than $120 million of federal funds which were available to provide social services such as hot meals, crisis counseling, or day care.</p>

<p>The state of our Southern being is not exceptional, it
appears. Similar trends can be found throughout the country. Perhaps,
a poll conducted by the New York Times and CBS News late last year
shows clearly what is the heart of our troubles in the region and the
nation. According to the poll, which didn't ask which political leader
is as popular as Walter Cronkite, three out of four Americans endorse
laws providing equal job rights for Blacks, women, and the handicapped; however, an equal number--three out of four also opposes strongly any "extra consideration" for remedying past job discrimination. In fact, only Blacks as a majority favored any such "extra consideration" at any time.</p>

<p>It is important to note than one major source of opposition to "extra consideration" came from those very groups of Whites who once supported the civil rights movement of the 1960's. The poll evidenced that White liberals in every region opposed the idea of "extra consideration" to remedy job discrimination at a rate of more than two to one. An endorsement of the principle, but not the means to achieve it, it appears.</p>

<p>Another disturbing, non-political poll last year showed that more
than four out of ten of all White churches in the country remain
segregated and, that in the South almost six out of every ten prohibit Blacks.</p>

<p>No doubt, there will bean opportunity for some of us to shed a bit of our present despair about politics when a cold November evening in the South shows the final results of this year's voters' wisdom. As in the past, some good folks may be elected. More important than those results, however, will be the actual results which come from our own attempts to restore the nation's faith in the importance of equality and to push the South and the country towards a future without the lingering burdens of inequality.</p>

<p>In that primary effort, we have no cause yet to voice our last hurrah.</p>

<head>My Sons Are Growing Up Racists</head>
<docAuthor>By Robert Hilldrup</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 1 No. 1, 1978, pp. 7</docDate>
<argument>Mr. Hilldrup was director of public information for the Richmond (Va.) Public Schools from 1969-76 during the integration and busing controversy.</argument>

<p>All my life, I've heard it said that the difference between us whites, South and North, is that the Southerner loved Blacks as individuals, and hated them as a race, while Northerners loved them as a race, and hated them as individuals.</p>

<p>Now, I see this pattern emerging in my own family: my sons are growing up racists, despite having lived in a family which was consistently involved in efforts to promote integration and racial justice.</p>

<p>To relate these efforts, by my wife and by myself, and the things we have endured from both Black and White as a result, would be self-serving. Worse, it would be embarassing, because what we have suffered is relatively little in comparison with the suffering of others--Black and White. Yet I am sure I speak for others who share my wife's persuasion and mine when I say that there is a growing feeling of isolation among us today, caught as we are between the hardening attitudes of fellow Whites at one end and the malignant violence of Black hatred at the other.</p>

<p>I have asked myself over and over why this trend, this attitude, seems to be emerging in the lives of our three boys. They are not budding Klansmen. In their collective lives, they may have had one fight each, and that was not interracial. They don't want to move from the home they have occupied since infancy in an integrated neighborhood. They still seem to enjoy the company of their Black companions and friends from college, from high school and from junior high.</p>

<p>But the signs of hardening hearts are there.</p>

<p> Perhaps I remained silent too long, listening, instead of talking. But parents who talk too much miss a chance to listen. And most of the time, the listening is a pleasure: talk of girls and soccer and baseball and food and cars and the eternal lack of money since we are a family which must struggle financially in a way that seems to us a bit grimmer than for most.</p>

<p>So we sat one evening, the college sophomore and I, alone in the summer twilight and I came at last to ask him about the changes in racial attitudes which had appeared in him and in his brothers.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and I sensed that he was choosing the words for his answer as carefully as I had chosen my question.</p>

<p>"Dad," he began, "I'm sorry. I know what you and mom have been through (as White educators in a Black school system), but it doesn't change what we see and what happens to us."</p>

<p>What followed was almost a litany and I knew, somehow, that speaking in terms of social policy and economics and politics and power didn't cut it with him. To this young man, and to his brothers, it was a matter of personal affront, of right and wrong.</p>

<p>He talked of the noise and vandalism in our neighhorhood that has increased with the arrival of more and more Blacks--Blacks with middle class jobs or better. He talked of the racial epithets that had been hurled at him and his mother from some of these same families.</p>

<p>He spoke of his brother in high school, who makes do with hand-me-down clothes, and of how he feels to see Blacks dressed in the most expensive way getting "free" lunches when he has to pay.</p>

<p>He talked of his own experience as a bag boy in a grocery where half the customers--and 90 per cent of the shoplifters--are Black, yet all come from the same middle class homes and apartments.</p>

<p>He talked of the struggle we were all sharing to try to put him and his brothers into the ranks of the college-educated, and then he named Black high school classmates accepted by colleges which rejected him when their scores were a combined total of 700 on college boards.</p>

<p>He talked of what his brothers saw in the public schools, of Blacks who would not attempt to do assigned work, and made it impossible for others to do theirs.</p>

<p>"Dad," he said in conclusion, 'Get with it. You and mom are living in a dream world."</p>

<p>That's where he's wrong. My wife and I are all too aware that,
proportionately, the negative stories and experiences of his life do
come far, far too often from Blacks. The wellspring of hatred is
overflowing in many areas of the modern South where Blacks now have
economic, political or numerical control. It does not feel good to be a minority and a blameless victim.</p>

<p>I know how my sons feel, and I am alternately saddened, ashamed and outraged. Yet I also know how Blacks of another generation must have felt, and this adds to my confusion, for the outrages being commited against Whites today are not coming so much from the Black generation which might be justified in extracting revenge, but from the youth which has known equal rights at worst, and favored treatment frequently.</p>

<p>My son went on and talked of other things: Blacks who wouldn't take
minimum wage jobs that White students were fighting to get; of our White neighbors who have been murdered and assaulted by Blacks.</p>

<p> The Darkness fell over us and our words and I couldn't help but think that Black Southerners and White Southerners need now, more than ever, to strive toward fairness and decency and justice, for each and for all; that indeed, we cannot stand separately and alone.</p>

<p>For with power comes responsibility. The Black majority which will
not work with the Whites to provide mutual safety and opportunity will
find, in the long run, that it cannot guarantee its own. For both the
Southerner and the Black are minorities in this nation and the return
of the Holocaust is something we dare not forget.</p>

<head>>How To Tell You're In The South</head>
<docAuthor>By Richard K. Thomas</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 1 No. 1, 1978, pp. 13-15</docDate>
<argument>"How To Tell You're In The South" was first printed in <hi rend="bold">Southwestern Journal</hi> Southwestern at Memphis, Spring 1977.</argument>

<p>For two centuries students of regional science have engaged in debates over the existence of a Southern region of the United States. If one is willing to concede that there Is, In fact, a "South," the question still arises as to where it begins and where it ends. Can some defining phrase be applied to the South in a manner similar to that by which the Mississippi Delta has been delineated as stretching from the lobby of the Hotel Peabody in Memphis to Catfish Row In Vicksburg? Or, are its boundaries too vague to be clearly defined? Is the transition from the South to the North, to the Mid-west and to the West too gentle to be noted or is there a sociocultural boundary noticeable to any traveler?</p>

<p>Since the 1900's, a series of attempts have been made to set the boundary between the South and the non-South. Some of the more subjective criteria utilized in this process have been derived from popular conceptions of the region. An example often noted in the media is the Mason and Dixon's Line. This 18th century demarcation, while initially serving to settle a boundary dispute between Pennsylvania and Maryland, came to be popularly accepted as the line separating the free and slave states. Despite the suggestion that the term "Dixie" is derived from this boundary, it is rather ineffective at setting even the northern perimeter of the region. (Not only that, but many of the stones implanted to mark its location have been stolen by souvenir hunters.)</p>

<p>A more scientific approach to the use of folk terminology in defining the region was attempted by John Reed, His analysis was based on the existence of the identifiers Southern" and 'Dixie" as attached to places of business. By examining the telephone directories of nearly 100 U.S. cities for the existence of companies, storages and agencies which included one of these terms in their name, he was able to delimit the section of the country where "Southern" was most frequently utilized and another similar, but not coterminous, area where "Dixie" predominated.</p>

<p> Some have suggested that Southerners constitute a bona fide "ethnic group" just as do PolishAmericans or MexicanAmericans. This would connote a certain Internal cohesiveness founded on shared attitudes, beliefs and values that, for the most part, cut across lines of race, sex, age and Income. The most frequently discussed manifestation of a Southern ideology is the traditional emphasis placed on racial segregation stemming from the notion of White superiority. This emphasis, it has been suggested, more than any other factor has made the South, and Southerners, distinctive.</p>

<p>Early in this century the pioneer Southologist, Howard W. Odum,
expounded a delineation of the South--he preferred the term
"Southeast"--based on objective measures reflecting the economy of the
region. Simply put, the South ended where agriculture ceased to be the
major source of employment; the rest of the Nation began where non-agricultural pursuits became dominant. To this end, Odum utilized over 700 indicators of the economic characteristics of the South and its borderlands. These included such variables as pasture land, farm acreage, extent of erosion, characteristics of wage earners, government outlay and types of vehicles. By utilizing this method he was able to precisely outline the area popularly termed the "South." Other of Odum's persuasion now use similar criteria.</p>

<p>Finally (in significance if not vintage), there is the
administrative delineation by the Bureau of the Census dating from
1942. The South outlined here is one of four grand regions into which
the U.S. has been divided. It stretches from the East Coast to the
western border of Texas--and as far North as the Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary. Thus, the South is drawn to include the likes of Oklahoma, West Virginia and Delaware.</p>

<p>This delineation is repugnant, of course, to the sensitivities of
my real Southerner, who can only snicker when he reads the "states within each of these divisions are for the most part fairly
homogeneous in physical characteristic, as well as in the
characteristics of their population and their economic and social conditions."</p>

<p>Admittedly, some East Texans are descended from the same Scotch-Irish bloodlines flowing throughout the Ozarks and the Appalachians, and Oklahoma is filled with Choctaw and Cherokee Indians whose traditional homelands were in the Deep South. But even given the fact that any real man in Tennessee owns Western boots and a hat, these states cannot be included with the likes of Alabama and Georgia. And what about Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia? Even if the last-named were admitted by default because of its Appalachian continuities to the South with Kentucky and Tennessee--let's face it--Delaware and Maryland are as far North as central Ohio.</p>

<p>In an outburst of understatement one demographer has recently
suggested that because of "changes In social and economic conditions" a different grouping might now be considered. Such a realignment was considered in 1955 when the distinction between regions was more obvious than today; the difficulty of changeover, however, was considered too great.</p>

<p>For my part each of these attempts to mark off what Is generally
perceived as the South has serious deficiencies. First of all, folk
categories are often derived from no-longer-appropriate historical
distinctions, they are hard to measure (how does one
<pb n="14"/>
quantify "Dixieism"?); and they may mean. different things to
different people. Reed's attempt is commendable but overlooks the fact
that it is easy to adopt a name. Thus non-Southern cities are filled
with companies bearing the descriptors "Dixie," "Southern," and
"Rebel." Reed himself points out that Chicago has more "Southern"
entries than does Macon, Georgia. Although the acceptance of business
names such as "Northern" and "Yankee" will be slow in gaining acceptance in the South, it is probable that the Southern region will have less of a monopoly on its traditional descriptors.</p>

<p>The use of psychosocial criteria in delineating the South suffers on two related grounds. In the first place, regional "character" as embodied by a generally accepted ideology is difficult to define and measure. Moreover, even the most tradition-bound ethnic group is certain to react and adapt (if not acquiesce) in the face of changing social conditions. The South is no longer isolated in any real sense and is, for all practical purposes, in the mainstream of 20th-century America.</p>

<p>A case in point is the traditional depiction of the South's people as racist. In view of the wide media coverage of recent racial conflicts outside of the South, it may be redundant to cite the changing status of Southern race relations. Southern schools are now more integrated than Northern schools; Southern neighborhoods more integrated than Northern neighborhoods. And three decades of public opinion polls have demonstrated the following transformation: in 1940, 98% of White Southerners considered separate school systems essential, while in 1970, only 16% of this group would object to sending their children to a school which included some Black students.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the political ideology of the Southerner has undergone considerable metamorphosis. Once solidly Democrat,the voters of the South have cast off long-lived party allegiances and--if the polls are to be believed--Southerners are today slightly less "conservative" than are Westerners and Midwesterners.</p>

<p>The method of delineation using objective data is the most susceptible to the forces of change. The South has become industrialized to an extent not imagined at the end of World War II and the region now leads the rest of the nation in urban growth. The traditional Southern ties to the land have weakened, in practice it not in sentiment. The emergence of agribusiness and the neoplantation in the South has depleted the ranks of farmers and farm laborers to the point that the agricultural pursuit is no longer a distinguished attribute of the region.</p>

<p>In view of the failures of all other methods, I propose an alternative and, I believe, foolproof process for accurately demarcating the South. This method combines some of the best characteristics of earlier attempts--objectivity, an embodiment of the psychosocial character of the people, and a reflection of the economic system of the region. Furthermore, it overcomes some of the deficiencies of other approaches. It uses easily collected data; it allows for a sharp rather than vague delineation of regional boundaries; and its defining measure has remained unchanged in the face of modernization.</p>

<p>It is important, I feel, to describe the manner in which this
"revelation" came to me. I had held an interest, off and on, in the
notion of a Southern-ness existing around me and felt, like most
residents of the region, that there were some, however vague,
boundaries that set us apart from the rest of America. The first
inkling of the existence of some defining characteristic came to me on
an automobile trip three years ago from Memphis to
St. Louis. Unquestionably, I was starting in the South with a
destination in the non-South, but it could not really be deter-
<pb n="15"/>
mined, I thought, where one ended and the other began. If one takes old Highway 61 into Missouri, a much better idea of the changing terrain--from Mississippi Delta to Missouri hills (the foothills of the Ozarks, I believe)--is evident. Not only does the topography suggest a transition is underway. Foreign-sounding names like Biehle, Weingarten and River Aux Vases appear on maps and roadsigns. Baptist churches give way to Lutheran and Catholic houses of worship. And what Southerner can forget the initial surprise at seeing St. Jude Acres subdivision beside the road? Although these changes are not abrupt and no clear-cut lines separate delta geography from Ozark-foothills or fundamentalism from ritualism, it is clear to the traveler that a transition is taking place.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Perryville, midway between Cape Girardeau and St. Genevieve, that the full implication of the border crossing was apparent. And it was here at the Intersection Cafe in Perryville that I discovered the key to the delineation of the South. Sitting in the restaurant, I felt an uneasiness; something told me we were at the border, but I could not ferret out the source of this feeling. I was convinced that the transition was taking place, but I needed proof.</p>

<p>Then, in a most unlikely place--the menu--I discovered what appears to be the one most significant variable in setting off the South and the non-South. There, listed under "Beverages"seeming to leap out--was "Pop." That was it! The line between the South and the non-South could be drawn at the point--a precise one, too--where carbonated beverages are no longer referred to as "cokes," "colas" or "soft drinks" but are ordered as "soda," 'pop" or "soda pop."</p>

<p>Subsequent research has borne out this significant breakthrough
with such points being identified all along the border. On the west, as one passes from Dallas to Tyler, Texas, the same phenomenon is observed. A line can be drawn setting off East Texas and cutting through Oklahoma; likewise across the northern reaches of the Southland; eastward from Perryville along a line stretching across southern Indiana into northernmost Kentucky (actually through the Cincinnati metropolitan area), on across Southern Ohio, through the heart of West Virginia and-alas!-cutting the northern fifth of Virginia, the essence of the Confederacy, off from the rest of the state.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the research on this important topic is in its early stages and extensive data collection and analysis have yet to be implemented. The conclusions to date have been based on unsystematic observations and interviews with selected "experts." Thus, the precise boundary-a border over 2,100 miles long, by the way--has not been established at every point. (It is probable that the final delineation will resemble more of a saw-tooth pattern than the smooth line suggested above.)</p>

<p>In any case, it appears that a foolproof method for delineating the South has been discovered. The faults df other methods are now really glaring. Anyone can name their company "Dixie Rents" or "Southern Leather"; ideology and beliefs are compromised in the face of changing conditions; agrarian lifestyles and occupation give way to urbanization and industrialization.</p>

<p>But the day when the boys who hang around the Red Ace filling station in Cullman, Alabama, walk into Grigsby's Grocery and order an orange pop, we'll know the South is dead.</p>

<head>A Dilemma: Overpopulation in Southern Prisons</head>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">"A free, democratic society cannot cage inmates like
animals or stack them like cattle in a warehouse and expect them to
emerge as decent, law-abiding, contributing members of the
community. In the end, society is the loser."</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Judge Charles R. Scott</hi></p>

<p>With these words and the stroke of a pen, in 1976 Judge Scott, a Federal Judge in Florida, found the Florida prison system in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution barring cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

<p>It is not an uncommon thing these days for Southern prison systems to be in this predicament. Across the South since 1975, five states have been told to stop overcrowding their prisons and a sixth, Tennessee, is currently a defendant in an undecided case. Chan Kendrick, the former director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Tennessee, who filed suit against the facility said the overcrowded conditions at the Transit Building, a converted warehouse made into a makeshift prison, were "simply unbelievable."</p>

<p>The main cause of the Eighth Amendment violations in regard to prison conditions centers on overcrowding. The South's prison systems are the most crowded in the nation. Overcrowding not only means an excess of bodies, but also overused medical facilities and overworked personnel. Funds that could be used for rehabilitation are often used elsewhere.</p>

<p>And despite popular opinion to the contrary, overcrowded prisons are not solving any crime problems. If anything at all, they are creating more. The crime rate continues to go up and recidivism soars.</p>

<p>Five of the top six states with high prison populations in ratio to the general population are in the South. These states, ranked in order from second to sixth, are North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas.</p>

<p>The source of this data, the March 1978 issue of <hi rend="bold">Corrections Magazine</hi>, lists four other Southern states as being in the Top Twenty. They are Virginia (12th), Louisiana (16th), Tennessee (17th) and Arkansas (20th).</p>

<p>And who is to blame for this wonderful state of affairs in Southern prisons? Even the administrators, the usual heavies of the correctional system foul-ups, cannot be held responsible for this condition. Prison administrators may be accountable for a lot of the defects of the system, but failing to warn the public about overcrowded conditions in the prisons is not one of them.</p>

<p>According to a <hi rend="bold">New York Times</hi> article dated January 24,1976, the prison administrators were trying to warn the Southern Governor's Conference about the overcrowding crunch at that time.</p>

<p>The front page <hi rend="bold">Times</hi> article said, "Southern prison officials are recommending a broad program of liberal reform to relieve prison overcrowding that they agree has reached crisis proportions."</p>

<p>The Governors had all sent representatives to that
gathering. Surely, at least one Southern Governor heard the ringing
words that the Secretary of the Department of Corrections for South
Carolina, William Leeke, told his colleagues: "I feel personally we
are going way beyond locking up the dangerous offender. It would
appear, and I believe most of my colleagues would agree, that in many
cases we are locking up people where it is totally counterproductive
to our purpose."</p>

<p>Leeke also warned that, "Increased tension and possible violence is the result of all this overcrowding. I know in my jurisdiction we are seeing more assaults of inmates on inmates and inmates on personnel."</p>

<p>"The first thing that overcrowding does is create tension," said Leroi X (Mason), an inmate at the Virginia State Penitentiary.</p>

<p>Mason, a recipient of ACLU's award for defense of the Bill of Rights, said overcrowding also produces crime and theft inside the prison. In Virginia where inmates get paid for the work they do, overcrowding causes unemployment and unemployment causes those inmates without jobs to steal from other inmates.</p>

<p>Despite the warnings, the politicians have found it productive in getting reelected to push for tougher crime laws, longer sentences and mandatory sentencing. In the United States, prisoners are given from two to three times longer sentences than European offenders for the same offense. Plus, they serve up to half or two-thirds of the term, a period considerably greater than the one European prisoners serve for the same offense.</p>

<p>But being rational does not always get the votes. When Federal Judge Frank Johnson of the Middle District of Alabama declared the Alabama prison system in violation of the Eighth Amendment in 1976, Wallace got into his favorite form denouncing liberal, soft-headed judges.</p>

<p>While one expects that from a man who stands in school house doors to block the desegregation of schools, Wallace's next door neighbor, Governor George Busbee, an alleged moderate, pulled one from the same bag of tricks.</p>

<p>In March of 1978, James Moss, a prisoner at the Georgia State Penitentiary in Reidsville was killed in an interracial scuffle. Sixteen others were wounded in the disturbance.</p>

<p>Prisoners blamed the death and injuries on overcrowded conditions. After all, prisoners pointed out, Reidsville was built for 1,500 and now houses, 2,700.</p>

<p>Busbee blamed the killing on that all time favorite Southern bogey man, race. <hi rend="bold">The Atlanta Journal</hi> on April 7, 1978 reports Busbee as saying, "The problem at Reidsville is caused by the integration of the sleeping quarters."</p>

<p>In Virginia, a state that ranks relatively low in overcrowded prison conditions, one can still see the headaches that overcrowding is causing for that state.</p>

<p>In the early 1970's, Virginia made plans to close the State Penitentiary in Richmond. Called by its occupants, "the Walls," the ominous structure, partially designed by Thomas Jefferson, was supposed to be closed by 1978. It is still in operation today and its supposed replacement, the Meckleburg Correctional Center, is already filled to capacity.</p>

<p>In nearby Powhatan County, Virginia, which has numerous minimum security prisons, the state is putting prisoners in old surplus house trailers. Local jails have become so overcrowded that the state refuses to take any new prisoners.</p>

<p>Powhatan County residents are upset about Virginia's new plans for more prisons there. The residents argued that more jails would turn their county into a "penal colony" where prisoners outnumbered residents.</p>

<p>If that was not enough in Virginia for one year, the Federal District Court for the Western part of the state declared that the Bland, Virginia Correctional Center was in violation of the Eighth Amendment for its overcrowded conditions.</p>

<p>Further South, Alabama was still trying to get around Judge
Johnson's court order and reduce overcrowding. But Alabama was<pb n="17"/> finding the going rough.</p>

<p>In 1978, attorneys for the Alabama Board of Corrections admitted that, prison construction "planned or currently underway won't keep pace with the number of new inmates."</p>

<p> "The sad thing about prison reformers," says Gene Guerrero, director of the ACLU of Georgia, "is that they know about the direct relationship between jobs and imprisonment. Yet, they tell legislators that through some new gimmick or new prison, they can deal with the criminal problem, while at the same time researchers are finding in Georgia that 75% of the state's sharp increase in prison population is directly attributable to unemployment. Despite knowing this, what they propose is building a new prison."</p>

<p>There were other voices that were warning against locking up prisoners and throwing away the key. One of these was William G. Nagel of the American Foundation, Institute of Corrections, a research group.</p>

<p>On February 9, 1976, Nagel wrote the following letter to Richard
Kwartler of <hi rend="bold" >Corrections Magazine</hi>:</p>

<p>"Any attempt to understand the increase in prison population should start with a study of practices in the South. On December 31, 1965, ten Southern states held 49,435 prisoners. According to your tabulations, the same ten states now hold 86,380 prisoners. That is an increase of 75.5%."</p>

<p>Nagel also pointed out that the other forty states had prison population increases of just 3.1%, but that the crime rate had increased in the South faster than in the North.</p>

<p>Another study by Nagel's American Foundation concluded that a state's rating on conservatism or liberalism had nothing to do with its success in fighting crime.</p>

<p>In a 1977 meeting of the American Correction's Association (ACA), Nagel and the American Foundation said, "There is no significant relationship between a state's rating on liberalism or conservatism and its reported rate of crime. However, conservative states have more people incarcerated."</p>

<p>The key culprit seems to be the law and order philosophy of heavier sentencing, less parole and probation and more time served in jail.</p>

<p>Added to this are stingy legislators who don't want to give the image to the folks down home that they are coddling criminals or putting up money for country club prisons.</p>

<p>On top of all this is the fact that nobody wants a prison near his home, even if the general populace does favor putting all the crooks away.</p>

<p>The most extreme example of this syndrome of wanting more prisons but not in my neighborhood occurred in Morristown, Tennessee where irate citizens tried to dynamite a 40% completed prison.</p>

<p>Depending on your degree of political realism, some may be shocked to know that New South racism has a lot to do with prison overcrowding. To a pessimist, that overcrowding in prisons might be the new wave to fill the void of what to do with Black folks.</p>

<p>There is a disproportionate number of Blacks in prison as compared to their proportions in the general population. For instance, the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond has a 70% Black population but Blacks constitute only 25% of the general population. Reidsville, Georgia has a 70% Black prison population and only a 30% Black general population. Black prison population proportions in the South are usually double their proportions in the general population.</p>

<p>What comedian Richard Pryor called 'justus" often passes for justice: Various studies, including one by the ACA, show that Blacks tend to get longer sentences for the same offense and have more encounters with police. "Those who say prison camps are concentration camps for the Blacks and the poor are quite correct," Guerrero said, "because it is Blacks and the poor who are pushed out of the economy when hard times come."</p>

<p>Perhaps using something of an overstatement, a Black Virginia mother whose son is serving 75 years in a prison there for the alleged rape of a white woman accurately described this kind of Southern prison: "I look around my church and wonder where all the young Black men are. All I see is women and old men. But now I know. They are all in prison."</p>

<p>The extreme insult, after locking all these folks up for years, is that study after study indicates that incarceration is a huge failure.</p>

<p>At the 18th annual Southern Conference on Corrections, back in the Stone Ages of 1973, it was noted in a report that "students of prison subculture have long understood that habitual forms of incarceration will increase the likelihood that convicted offenders will persist in criminal activities after their release from prison."</p>

<p>It's a social merry-go-round. We put people in jail for corrections and punishment and they come out crazier than when they went in.</p>

<p>At the same conference, so called alternatives to incarceration, even "alternatives to court exposure" were called an "obvious future trend."</p>

<p>These alternatives have hit upon hard times. Court room alternatives are now overshadowed by plea bargaining and overloaded court dockets.</p>

<p>Alternatives to incarceration such as half-way houses, work release centers, community work sentences, etc. could be utilized to cut down on the prison population. But the percentage of prisoners in these type of facilities has not increased significantly in the last four years or so.</p>

<p>The choices are clear. Just like the man in the Sunoco commercial
says about services to automobiles, "You can pay me now, or pay me
later." The same holds true for the prison overpopulation
problem. Either society can make a real effort to reduce overcrowding
and its root causes, or it can pay later when expensive Federal court
cases roll around and when the soaring crime rate and increased
recidivism requires more and more of your tax dollars to build more
and more caging facilities.</p>
