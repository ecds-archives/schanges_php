<p>As the body of writing about women in the Southern black freedom struggle continues to grow, new studies take a comparative and analytical approach to the varieties of women's activism and the ways in which race, class, gender, and culture shape leadership and political roles. Sociologist Belinda Robnett's <title>How Long? How Long?</title> attempts a unified, comprehensive account of African-American women activists from 1954-1965. By placing black women at the center of analysis within the broader history of the Southern civil rights movement, Robnett aims to reconceptualize the movement's leadership and organization as well as delineate the complexity of women's experiences. Robnett examines the roles of activists within seven movement organizations National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Women's Political Council (WPC), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE),the Montgomery Improvement Association (MM the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Using oral testimony from the women themselves, Robnett explores relationships among movement participants and offers a critique of black leadership. Also, Robnett challenges claims regarding sexism in the movement as she unravels the complex web of relationships among the movement's leaders and rank-and-file.</p>
<p>Robnett provides us a "socio-historical" analysis of the movement framed by a womanist/black feminist stand point. Using the term defined by novelist Alice Walker, such an analysis reflects <q direct="unspecified">"a consciousness that incorporates racial, cultural, sexual, national, economic and political considerations."</q> By examining both the "Symbiotic" and "conflictual relationships" between black women and men, Robnett challenges conventional theories of leadership as well as theories of social movement formation. She argues that <q direct="unspecified">"a substantial proportion of the processes of recruitment, mobilization and sustenance"</q> of the Civil Rights Movement was performed by African- American women. Black women had limited access to key positions of formal leadership, even though they were well-represented among the rank and file. As "bridge leaders," a term Robnett coined, women sewed in an important intermediate capacity; they were the vital link between nationally recognized male leaders and the masses of people. Critical to the movement's success, especially at the local level, they were able to <q direct="unspecified"> "bridge, extend, amplify and transform"</q> the movements message.</p>
<p>Robnett's chapter "Women and the Escalation of the Civil Rights Movement," is the book's strongest, best-articulated example of her theory of bridge leadership at work. Here, she examines the role of women in sustaining the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott. She correctly attributes the overall success of the 381-day boycott to the infrastructure provided by middle-class women of the Women's Political Council (WPC). Under the leadership of Alabama State college professor Mary Fair Burks, who founded the organization in 1946, this group of professional black women had long been concerned about the discriminatory treatment on city buses that African-American women who rode to and from their jobs as domestic workers endured each day. At least three years prior to the arrest of Rosa Parks, the WPC conceived the idea for mass protest and attempted to negotiate with the mayor and the city's bus officials, warning them that, if conditions on the buses did not improve, the black community would be forced to take action. Following Parks arrest, in the early stages of mobilization the WPC was instrumental in working with black male leaders to formulate plans for the boycott. Women's leadership was relatively visible at the outset; however, as formalization of movement activities coalesced and organizational structure emerged, their visibility and power receded. Instead, men were given titled positions within the newly formed Montgomery Improvement Association evil A), the organization behind civil rights activities in the city. While women did, in fact, chair certain committees within the MIA, such as Welfare and Membership, a gendered division of labor emerged.</p>
<p>Insightful interviews with key movement participants such as Mrs. Johnnie Can and Mrs. Thelma Glass illuminate how, in the absence of access to formal leadership, women re-directed their energies in support of men while creatively seeking avenues for political self-expression. According to the author, <q direct="unspecified"> "gender, as a construct of exclusion, produced a particular context in which women participated. This level of leadership, while largely invisible to the media and many scholars, was a critical link in movement formation."</q></p>
<p>Robnett offers other examples of women's bridge leadership, notably the role of women in the early years of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Here again, the symbiosis of women collaborating with male leadership is evidenced as well as the conflicts and tensions they experienced in dealing with men whose conventional views on women were gender-biased. She explores women's roles within the youth-based Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and attributes their greater participation and influence to the organization's structure, which was based on leadership by consensus and decentralization of power. This factor tended to mitigate against traditional beliefs-though they did surface- and offer a "free space" where young people, both black and white alike, were able to move beyond the confines of stereotypical roles. Robnett chronicles the heroism and risk-taking activism of SNCC's powerful, black female leaders, including Muriel Tillinghast, Faye Bellamy, Ruby Doris Smith Robinson, Diane Nash, Carole Merritt, Mary Lane and others. In discussing women's roles within SNCC, however, Robnett's categories become a bit unwieldy. Ella Baker, for example, was described as a "professional bridge leader" while Diane Nash was considered as a "formal local community bridge leader."  The subtle distinctions become a bit confusing and indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Robnett takes on the thorny issue of sexism within SNCC and the emergence of feminist consciousness that grew out of white women's experiences in the movement. She criticizes some earlier studies of gendered relationships within SNCC that excluded the experiences of black women while over-emphasizing the relationships between black men and white women.</p>
<p>Robnett concludes by tracing the ideological shift from civil rights to black nationalism and the backlash to women's leadership which emerged in the late 1960s and early 70s. The shift to Black Power in SNCC led to a more centralized organization, one which was less inclusive of black women's leadership. She argues that contemporary black leadership is predominantly male, a pattern which owes its legacy, not to the egalitarian, all-inclusive philosophy of early SNCC, but to the legacy of black nationalism which followed after 1964. Citing recent examples such as the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas situation and the Million Man March, Robnett suggests that in recent years, we have experienced an escalation of gender tensions between black men and women. She contends that future generations must reclaim the legacy of the civil rights years, particularly, the early SNCC model, where black women were at the forefront of the struggle for social change.</p>
<p>There are still so many stories to tell, particularly in recounting the experiences of grassroots women. Activists such as Mississippi's Winson and Dovie Hudson, and L C. Dorsey, for example, deserve attention. I am also looking forward to hearing more from SNCC's white female participants, some of whom were interviewed here. Robnett's significant contribution to scholarship on African-American women's activism has deepened our understanding of the Civil Rights Movement and raised a number of critical questions worth further pursuit.</p>

               <head>Seeing Appalachian Cities</head>

<p>Since at least the turn of the nineteenth century, the people of the Appalachian mountains have been stereotyped as backward, backwoods hillbillies. In popular culture, Appalachia uniformly consists of near wilderness hills and hollows where folks live without access to any of the accouterments of modern life. The people who live there have been denigrated and scorned for what is seen as their inability or refusal to keep up with "progress."</p>
<p>Reacting against the assumption that progress is an unequivocal blessing, defenders of an Appalachian way of life have acknowledged the persistence of a more rural, more isolated, and less modern mountain existence.  Those defenders -- Appalachian Studies scholars/activists, film makers at Appalshop in Whitesburg, Kentucky, and others -- simultaneously asserted the dignity of the rural mountain lifestyle. They pointed to Appalachians' propensity to love and live off of the land as an antidote to a destructive, wasteful, and exploitative relationship to the environment. By accepting the premise that Appalachians are different from other Americans while reversing the value judgment placed upon them, Appalachianists have fashioned what Manuel Castells refers to as a "resistance identity," The Appalachian resistance identity has been crucial to an Appalachian identity movement which con tin- lies to inform and galvanize.</p>
<p>A parallel form of identity politics has been very important in my life. In the women movement, identity politics set out to mobilize women against oppression, help them reclaim characteristics often denigrated as "feminine," and open up new ways for imagining a just society. When I moved back to Bristol, Tennessee, in 1996, I found the potential of Appalachian identity politics to offer an alternative vision to our increasingly industrialized, money-chasing culture irresistible. Yet as I looked around me, I saw thousands of Bristolians, "Appalachians" and newcomers alike, living what was obviously not a quintessentially "Appalachian" lifestyle. At the same time, some city residents expressed their hope that Bristol could become the "Gate way to Appalachia."</p>
<p>I turned to the Appalachian Studies literature to help me understand the dynamics. How to understand cities in an Appalachian context? Could city residents be considered Appalachian? Many shared a common history with others from the region -- family who farmed the land or mined coal or still lived more than an hour from the nearest Blockbusters or (less and less) Wal-mart. Initially, I was unable to discover any discussion of what it meant to be city and mountain, or to inherit values which were apparently inherently contradictory. Until the past couple of years (in work by Appalachianists like Anne Mitchell Whisnant and Kevan Frazier), in any discussion of "Appalachianness," the cities of the region seemed to disappear.</p>
<p>Yet even in 1965 when the federal government labeled the Appalachian underdeveloped region deserving of aid, between 47-31 percent of its residents fit the federal definition of "urban." Although the number of urban residents in Appalachia increased 15 percent from 1960 to 1990, the proportion of Appalachians living in urban versus rural areas increased 47.18 percent after reaching a high of 48.44 percent urban in 1970. However, the federal definition (designating residents of towns of 2,500 or more as "urban") obscures the fact that in 1990, a greater proportion of Appalachians lived in the region's largest cities than ever before.</p>
<p>To observe this shift, we might begin by looking at just the "core" region of Appalachia. Appalachian historian John Alexander Williams derived his definition of core Appalachia from the six historically most influential delimitations of the region. Williams' definition covers 164 counties in eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, northern Georgia, western North Carolina and Virginia, and much of West Virginia. Although the U.S. Bureau of the Census designates residents of towns with a population of 2,500 as urban, it reserves the label "city" for those "incorporated places" with a population of 25,000 or more. There are numerous such cities in core Appalachia. As of 1994, the U.S. Bureau of the Census considered two core Appalachian cities -- Chattanooga, Tennessee (pop. 152,000) and Knoxville, Tennessee (pop. 169,000)- "principal cities," defined as cities with a population of 100,000 or more. The Census also distinguishes between principal cities and those cities whose population exceeds 200,000; no core Appalachian cities are among the seventy-seven U.S. cities which meet this criterion.</p>
<p>In addition to defining cities, the U.S. Bureau of the Census also designates metropolitan statistical areas and "Large Metropolitan Areas." At least one county of seven Large Metropolitan Areas (defined as having populations of over 250000) tails within core Appalachia -- Chattanooga, Knoxville; Charleston, West Virginia; Huntington, West Virginia; Ashland, Kentucky; Hickory-Morganton, North Carolina; Johnson City-Kingsport Bristol, Tennessee; Virginia (the 'Fri-Cities); and Atlanta, Georgia. Of these, only Chattanooga, Knoxville, and the Tri-Cities "Large Metropolitan Areas" fall completely within core Appalachia. Two smaller U.S. Bureau of the Census metropolitan statistical areas, Asheville, North Carolina, and Roanoke, Virginia are also at least partially in core Appalachia. Of the two, only the Asheville statistical area (population 191,774) falls completely within bounds.</p>
<p>In 1990,the l64 counties had a population of 5,567,736. Whereas the U.S. Bureau of the Census definition indicates a steady percentage of Appalachians living an "urban' lifestyle, measuring the percentage of Appalachians living in these metropolitan areas establishes a different picture over time. In 1960, 19 percent of Appalachians lived in a county "anchored" by one or more of the MSA's central cities (meaning the home county of Knoxville, Chattanooga, Bristol and Sullivan County, Tennessee and Washington County, Virginia), Johnson City, Asheville, Charleston, and Morganton. However in 1997, 1,379,637 people, or 25 percent, of core Appalachian residents lived in a county for which at least part could be characterized as "city."</p>
<p>Even more striking than this 6 percent increase is the shift in the percentage of Appalachians living in a metropolitan statistical area. In 1960, 24 percent or one out of every four Appalachians lived in a county which by 1997 had become part of a metropolitan statistical area. In 1997, 2,145,813 people, or 39 percent of all Appalachians. re sided within a metropolitan statistical area boundary.</p>
<p>What does this population increase of 15 percent in metropolitan counties indicate? It could be caused by an influx of non-Appalachian middle and upper class Americans moving into rather homogenous American suburbs surrounding cities with increasingly fewer Appalachians or fewer people retaining "Appalachian" characteristics. It could, however, mask a characteristically Appalachian desire to obtain paychecks in more urban or industrial areas while maintaining not a suburban but a more rural lifestyle (with cash-based employment augmented by farming or gardening) outside the city. The 15 percent increase in metropolitan Appalachians might be due to a combination of the two, or could vary according to the city in question, or could mean something entirely different.</p>
<p>The point is, we don't really know.</p>
<p>Those interested in the production and persistence of "Appalachian-ness" and in the alternative values purportedly embraced by Appalachians have concentrated almost solely on rural Appalachia. Their work is of course vital to a complete understanding of the region; while some portions of the region have a very large metropolitan population (East Tennessee is 66 percent metropolitan), there are also huge tracts of the mountain region (as in a twenty-seven-county-area in southeastern Kentucky) in which no metropolitan statistical area can be found. Finally, however, recognizing the existence of cities within Appalachia may rearrange or even sharpen the tools available for thinking about the region and the political movement centered around it-for at least three reasons.</p>
<p>First, given the shrinking number of people who experience an unadulterated rural Appalachian lifestyle, it may become more and more difficult for people to claim the Appalachian resistance identity. The movement will be on ever-more slippery ground if it attempts to enlist only those who could be considered quintessentially Appalachian. Appalachian scholar-activists themselves have often come from, been educated in, or currently live in the metropolitan areas of the region. Preliminary discussions with some of today's leading Appalachianists indicates that growing up in cities often meant greater exposure to stereotyping and denigration of mountain values and mountain heritage; this would indicate that rather than those who grew up isolated and to some degree sheltered, residents of large mountain towns or cities had the greatest need for the affirmation offered by the Appalachian identity movement.</p>
<p>Second, Appalachian cities may encourage more scholarship on the uneven geographic development associated with capitalism. Ultimately even the most rural of areas is involved in and affected by the same processes of urbanization as are cities-as evidenced by the rearrangement of demography and geography achieved by capitalists' introduction of coal mining in Appalachia and by (to give a more contemporary example) the appearance of chain stores in otherwise "rural" areas. Lastly, perhaps we need to ask if the accumulation of capital in Knoxville is any less damaging than the depletion of rural Appalachian resources for the enrichment of wealthy capitalists in New York.</p>
<p>The final suggestion I would like to make here is that grappling with the phenomenon of Appalachian cities, and perhaps the Appalachian-ness of cities or the urbanity of some Appalachians, may help to temper the tendency to romanticize the people of the region.</p>
<p>An ever-increasing number of Appalachian residents are being affected by and/or are participating in urbanization in the region. If it ever made sense to think of a pre-modern rural Appalachia entrenched against wealthy urban outsiders, we are quickly outgrowing the suitability of such a model. Appalachianists could continue to throw away inclusive geographic boundaries of the region and persist in pointing to the shrinking spaces of rurality and poverty as the "real" Appalachia. But to do so would mean missing crucial transformations in the dynamic economy and culture of the region. To do so would negate the threads of continuity between the region's past and its present, between what options were available to the region's inhabitants in the past and the options available now. It would seem crucial for us to understand how, in Appalachia, turn-of-the-century capitalism and mid-century industrialization have given way to a late-twentieth-century service economy and a continued concentration of people and wealth. Perhaps developing a new schema for understanding Appalachia-one capable of incorporating Appalachian cities-is the first step.</p>
