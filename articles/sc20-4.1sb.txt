A "New Southern Agenda"

Education: In order for this country to flourish as a free and open democratic society in the 21st century, we must make the transformation of our public learning institutions the highest priority of our local, state, and national governments.

Health: We need a universal plan to put an adequate floor of medical security under every person, helping healthy people to stay healthy and sick people to get well, and offering basic care to the most vulnerable among us-the youngest and oldest, persons with disabilities, the poor. The bottom line must be access and affordability for all, as a fundamental right.

Employment: Every member of our community should have the opportunity to earn a liv

ing wage that yields adequate income and benefits. We support it so strongly, in fact, that we want the public and private sectors to join together in guaranteeing full employment and economic opportunity to all members of our community.

Housing: Every person in our community must have access to a safe, comfortable, and affordable place to live and grow, free from environmental hazards.

Justice: The equal

administration of justice is paramount to civil society. Citizens must have equal protection under the law, and the expectation that our system ofjustice will be applied firmly without regard for race, color, national origin, sexual orientation or economic status.
