USDA Error Deprives Thousands of Food

An error, made by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in its federal allocation of funds for the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, has deprived over 5,000 participants of supplemental foods. The error was discovered by Judy Currie, a Southern Regional Council researcher, after weeks of analyzing the program.

Currie found that USDA used a method of allocating funds that resulted in a loss of over $10 million to twelve states and a gain of over $10 million to twelve other states. Included in the states that lost funds were Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama.

One of the factors that makes the error particularly damaging is that Alabama and Mississippi have historically failed to make adequate use of the federal program which provides food to lowincome families.

Largely as a result of a concerted effort on the part of nutrition advocates in both states, this situation was beginning to turn around in the last half of FY 1978. These states were no longer turning back money and participation was steadily increasing. Mississippi reached a high of 43,039 participants in November 1978: Alabama 31,745. Unfortunately, by February these totals

had been cut to 38,959 and 28,669 respectively - a drop of over 7,000 people- The food package received by Mississippians was also reduced sharply during the same period as a result of the state health department's effort to stay within its budget.

The Southern Poverty Law Center and a number of plaintiffs including the Alabama Coalition Against Hunger have amended a pending lawsuit against the state and USDA to recover the Alabama share of the losses. Other lawsuits are expected to follow. To date no positive response has been forthcoming from USDA.
