<p>A few weeks ago I received a letter from Cheryl A. Swanson, a
student in Massachusetts who had just finished reading Robert Coles'
book, <hi rend="italic">Still Hungry in America</hi>. She wrote,
"After seeing pictures of how some people live in this country, I felt
very guilty. I was moved by their courage and would like to help them
in some way. I admire what you are doing and would like to hear about
any progress you have made since 1969."</p>

<p>This issue of <hi rend="italic">Southern Changes</hi> will be sent
to Ms. Swanson because it portrays far better than my letter of reply
that state of health of the South and especially poor
Southerners. Although all the issues and developments in the last ten
years aren't given a forum here, the major themes represent the new
energy, faith, and failures which have come along.</p>

<p>The past president of the Council Ray Wheeler, has lived with and
treated the pain and hurt of poverty and hunger fo more than 30 years
and in our Soapbox piece he presents a thoughtful perspective onthe
threat of hunger and ill-health to all of us. Ray not only reminds us
that there are reasons of self interest for everyone to address the
problems of poverty and hunger but also insists that it is the only
thing that people who care can do.</p>

<p>The same broad definition of health care be seen in the works of
the Student Health Coalition in Alabama. As Harriet Swift
sympathetically describes the people and scenes of a health fair in
rural Black Belt Alabama, we are told how young students are trying to
help imediately care for people's needs while not forgetting
apparently the larger, more important social forces that decide
whether one lives or dies are not measured by EKGs.</p>

<p>Bob Powell and Marie Jemison also contribute to the theme of this
issue in their pieces on public housiing and the race for a federal
judgeship. Both suggest in their own way a bleak future for what only
months ago was considered recent hopeful developments in the course of
government affairs.</p>

<p>In "The Making of a Ghetto" Powell shows that shifting the poors'
housing from one area to another doesn't remove the old forces of
local politics and bureaucratic inability to give folks a decent
chance to help themselves. Jemison provides us with a case study of
how people are chosen &#x2014; or not chosen  &#x2014; to site as the
arbitrators of the major legal issues affecting the poor and all of
us.</p>

<p>Two of our department pieces also touch upon issues affecting the
life and eath of the poor: taxes and women on death row.</p>

<p>Overall, the October issue testifies to the spirit of Southerners
continuing to probe for answers and improvements in the human
condition. Like the whole of this issue, Cheryl Swanson's letter means
a great deal. It's good to know that there are those who still care,
searching to know and do more about very specific causes and
conditions that plague life for many and threaten the body and soul of
everyone.</p>

grammatically correct &#x2014; but unfortunately it left an incorrect

<head>The Crisis of Conscience</head>
<docAuthor>By Staff</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 2, No. 2, 1979, pp. 3-4</docDate>

<p>Three out of five federal judges in the South and probably a majority in the nation belong to segregated, all-White, social clubs, according to a report released by the Southern Regional Council.</p>

<p>In a survey of the social club memberships of federal judges in eleven Southern states and four non-Southern cities, SRC found that of the 127 Southern federal district judges, 58 percent belong to a social club or association that has never had a Black or other minority member. Southern federal circuit court judges were even more likely to have segregated memberships. Sixty-one percent of the circuit judges belong to all-White clubs.</p>

<p>"A crisis of conscience exists in the country's federal judiciary," says Steve Suitts, SRC executive director and author of the report. "The prevalence of memberships in segregated clubs and associations among federal judges endangers the appearance of impartiality and fairness of the third branch of the government."</p>

<p>Results of the survey, undertaken over the past nine months, show that the pattern of segregated associations is not confined to the South. Federal circuit and district court judges in four non-Southern cities - Los Angeles, St. Louis, Chicago, and Baltimore - were only slightly less likely to belong to all-White clubs. Fifty-one percent of the judges in these cities hold such memberships.</p>

<p>In the Southern states, Florida had a larger percentage of judges with exclusive club memberships than any other state. The majority of federal judges in every Southern state except South Carolina belonged to all-White clubs. The judges in the district courthouses in Birmingham, Houston, Miami and Dallas represented the largest numbers of judicial officers with segregated club memberships of any Southern location in the study.</p>

<p>One federal judge in Miami, Florida, had memberships in six segregated clubs. Most judges belong to only one such club.</p>

<p>The survey does not identify by name individual judges who belong to all-White clubs. "There is no attempt here to embarrass any individual. The issue is whether any judge can properly belong to such clubs," says Suitts, "and the problem is that segregated clubs are the preference of most federal judges."</p>

<p>The report is based upon information collected from published sources, civil rights organizations, lawyers, and club members as of January 1, 1979. No judges appointed since that time were included in the study.</p>

<p>The issue of membership in segregated clubs was before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee recently when Memphis federal judge Bailey Brown refused to resign his membership in an all-White club in order to be confirmed for a circuit judgeship. After delaying negotiations, Judge Brown agreed to "suspend" his membership and the vote on his confirmation is expected soon.</p>

<p>The SRC report also cites an incident involving federal district judge David Belew who took office in May. When asked about the questioning before the Senate Judiciary by a local reporter, Judge Belew responded "that the questionnaire about niggers did not come up." Since the first of the year, the Senate Judiciary Committee has required all nominees to the federal bench to complete a questionnaire that includes a question about membership in all-White clubs.</p>

<p>"Our findings demonstrate that the question of all-White club memberships must be faced and resolved by the entire federal court system," the SRC director stated. "It is time for collective soul-searching," he added.</p>

<p>The report calls for the U.S. Judicial Conference, the
administrative arm of the federal courts, or the U.S. Supreme Court,
to consider the issue and "the fundamental eroding effect that such
widespread conduct by
<pb n="4"/>
judges has upon the foundation of the judiciary."</p>

<p>The SRC recommends that the Code of Judicial Conduct be interpreted to Prohibit judicial officers from belonging to clubs and associations that never have had Black or other minority members.</p>

<p>If the court fails to address the problem, Suitts says that Congress and the President should exert "moral leadership to show that public officials - even in the judicial branch - must avoid the appearance of bias." The SRC suggests that Congress and the President confer with members of the federal judiciary and "within the limits" use constitutional powers to require the courts' judges to address the issue.</p>

<p>Also, the report asks that Congress and the President set a firm policy of refusing to nominate or confirm anyone who maintains membership in all-White clubs or associations.</p>

<p>Referring to two other recent SRC studies on the federal judiciary, Suitts noted that "today we have a court system that has only a handful of Black judges, maintains discriminatory employment practices that no other agency would be permitted to have, and, as we see now, has most of its judges going to dinner at segregated, all-White clubs. The integrity of the courts are in jeopardy."</p>

<p>A copy of the SRC report, entitled "A Crisis of Conscience: Federal
Judges in Segregated Clubs," is available for $3.00 by writing the SRC
at 75 Marietta Street, N.W., Atlanta, Georgia 30303.</p>

<head>The Threat of Hunger and Ill-Health</head>
<docAuthor>By Ray Wheeler</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 2, No. 2., 1979, pp. 5-8</docDate>
<argument>
Raymond Wheeler is a physician in Charlotte, N.C. and past president
of the Southern Regional Council.
</argument>

<p>The existence of hunger and malnutrition among the poor and occurring throughout the United States has been established beyond debate. It seems likely also beyond argument that the expansion of the Federal Food Assistance Programs has significantly altered the face of hunger in our country. We know, however, that there continues to be many people in our nation who are malnourished and who do not have the food or the health care necessary to restore themselves to health and full productivity.</p>

<p>The number of persons in poverty began to increase in 1970 and has not declined since then. There is reason to believe that the real incidence of poverty is higher than the poverty statistics would indicate.Whether the real poverty count is 25 million or more likely 30 million Americans, the incredible fact remains that we have in this country an enormous number of people living at or below the federally defined poverty level and, by definition, they cannot afford to purchase a minimally adequate diet unless they receive assistance.</p>

<p>During the past twelve years I have taken part in surveys of hunger and malnutrition and remember well the conditions and people who faced a blighted future without much hope and assistance. In the spring of 1967 shortly after a Senate Subcommittee, led by Joseph Clark and Robert Kennedy first brought hunger to the attention of the American people, I was one of a group of physicians who went as a team to study the health and living conditions of children of the poor. Here is what we found:

<q><p><hi rend="italic">"Wherever we went and wherever we looked,
whether it was the rural South, Appalachia, or an urban ghetto, we saw
children in significant numbers who were hungry and sick, children for
whom hunger was a daily fact of life and sickness in many forms, an
inevitability. Many of these children were weak and in pain; their
lives were being shortened; they were, in fact, visibly and
predictably, losing their energy, their spirit and their health. They
were suffering from hunger and disease, and directly or indirectly, many were dying."</hi></p></q></p>

<p>Wherever we went the impact was the same. We saw countless families with large numbers of children isolated from the mainstream of American culture and opportunity, possessing none of the protections of health, life and job that other Americans take for granted as rights of citizenship.</p>

<p>What we saw on those trips and the conclusions we drew have been documented and substantiated over and over again. As a result, unprecedented publicity, surveys, reports, TV documentaries, Presidential messages, a select committee of the U.S. Senate on Nutrition and Human Needs, and even two White House conferences, occurred. The nation was shocked and in the years that followed Congress, responding to public pressures and public needs, enacted more than a dozen food aid laws and now appropriates more than 9 billion dollars annually to feed the poor.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this generous outpouring of money for food and medical care by our government and by concerned citizens over the past ten years has saved many lives and relieves great suffering. The statistics speak eloquently to this point.</p>

<p>There has been a decline in infant mortality of 33 percent from 1965 to 1975 with even more rapid decline in deaths of infants during the first month of life. Infant deaths from diarrhea, influenza, pneumonia, and immaturity, in any related directly to poverty and malnutrition, have declined 50 percent or more. These reductions in mortality have occurred more rapidly among Blacks and American Indians and in the ten states with the highest incidence of poverty and malnutrition.</p>

<p>The observations of the 1977 Medical Team sponsored by the Field Foundation support the accuracy of this information. From May to September, 1977, six teams of doctors fanned out across the country, carefully retracing steps many of us had taken ten years earlier into the worst poverty in America. "We went again into the delta of Mississippi, the tenements of the Bronx, the isolated mountain hollows of Appalachian Kentucky, the coastal regions of South Carolina and the migrant work camps of Central Florida. Our first and overwhelming impression was that there are far fewer grossly malnourished people in this country today than there were ten years ago."</p>

<p>When one visits the Head Start centers and examines the children, even cursorily, there can be little doubt that significant change has occurred since 1967. The children of the poor were healthy in appearance, lively and responsive in their interactions with each other and with their teachers. Nowhere did I see the gross evidence of malnutrition, the omnipresent evidence of acute respiratory illness, and the evidence of apathy and weakness that we saw in 1967. The teachers I questioned reported very few problems with illness among the children during the entire year.</p>

<p>The problem is not now primarily one of overt hunger and malnutrition, although unquestionably these conditions have not been eliminated. It is not possible to find so easily the bloated bellies, the shriveled infants, the gross evidences of vitamin and protein deficiencies in children that we identified in the late sixties.</p>

<p>Instead, my colleagues and I observed more subtle manifestations of malnutrition, especially among the poor in those areas where food-aid systems are functioning inadequately and are not reaching those who need help.</p>

<p>Undernutrition often masquerades as other kinds of problems. Many of these children already malnourished at birth, are born prematurely because malnutrition in the mother is the most common cause of prematurity and prematurity is directly linked to early infant mortality, birth defects and mental retardation.</p>

<p>Many undernourished infants die shortly after birth, killed by their unusual susceptibility to infections which are ordinarily benign in the well nourished child. Those children surviving infancy are more frequently ill, likely to be anemic and undersized for age, and they do less well in school than their counterparts in more affluent families.</p>

<p>They become slow learners, who wind up living in poverty and
producing children who grow up in the vicious cycle which condemns
them to lifetimes of marginal function.
<pb n="7"/>
Their lives are characterized by behavioral disturbances, physical disability, high rates of failure in school and low levels of employability.</p>

<p>The social and economic consequences of this tragic sequence of events are enormous and devastating to the children and to the society in which they grow up. By not feeding children adequately, we may be negating our efforts to educate them and we are undoubtedly creating problems for the future.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the effects of inadequate food, bad housing and poor medical care are not confined to the poor but directly determine the strength and vitality of our society, the amount of wealth and produce, and the incomes we enjoy. More than 10 years ago the Office of the Budget calculated that for every dollar we failed to spend feeding hungry people, it costs our government over three dollars in payment of sickness care, lower productivity, so-called "handouts" to the disabled. I suspect that the figures are equally or even more applicable today. As Robert Claiborne wrote recently "A balance sheet of the dollar costs of poverty versus dollar cost of ending it might well show that even in purely economic terms, humanity is the best policy."</p>

<p>I know that the health status of Southern people remains the worst in the nation, far below national averages in most of the parameters we use to judge health. But, I also know that the remedy for this situation lies not in more doctors, nurses, and hospitals. It lies in a rearrangement of the priorities of our society so that public policy addresses human needs.</p>

<p>While much has been said and written about the economic resurgence of the South since 1945 and especially in the decades of the 60s and 70s, we are not as prosperous as we appear. We are still behind significantly (17 percent) in per capita income. A large proportion of the nation's poor live in the South. We have 25 percent of the population of the U.S. and 40 percent of its poor. Sixty percent of the nation's rural poor live in the South and one in five Southerners is poor, double the national rate. Both our industrial wages and our per child expenditures for education are the lowest in the nation.</p>

<p>Our position at the bottom of the ladder is equally solid when we examine health statistics as one would expect for health care and economic development are integrally related.</p>

<p>General death rates are 22 percent higher in the rural South than in the nation. The life expectancy of migrant farmers is 49 years, 23 years less than the national average. Infant mortality rates are higher than the national average for Black and White Southerners as are the rates for premature births, but in the rural South Blacks have 65 percent higher rates than their White neighbors.</p>

<p>The existing institutions for the delivery of medical care, no matter how they are restructured or paid for, may be irrelevant to the central health issue. All things considered, even acknowledging the remarkable benefits from recent advances in medical science and technology, the health services of the twentieth century that have been most influential for improving health have had to do with sanitation, water supply, and food distribution. The main reason we enjoy longer and healthier lives than our ancestors is not that we possess more effective ways of treating our sicknesses, though in many cases we do. We are more healthy and longer living because we get sick less often thanks to prevention of infectious disease, the provision of pure water and sanitary sewage disposal systems, and the greater availability of food.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important public health measure in our history has been the gradual evolution of a society in which people - most people - are living better. There is more money for food, family sizes are smaller, work hours are shorter and work less exhausting.</p>

<p>Associated with these advances have been major advances in the
processing, storage, and distribution of food. These overall benefits
have done more to reduce morbidity and
<pb n="8"/>
mortality rates and to extend life expectancy than perhaps any other societal endeavor including those directly related to coping with illness. It is likely that the greatest promise for improved health for most populations, including the South's, in the foreseeable future continues to be related to the possibilities for improved nutrition.</p>

<p>There are many initiatives that might improve nutrition. They include the regulation of a advertising, improvement of housing, and public education about diet and nutrition. None of these will be effective in the absence of an effort to increase the availability of food. Local and privately initiated efforts of this kind are desirable and praiseworthy, but success on a meaningful scale demands a public policy dedicated to a more equitable distribution of food to poor people and to particularly vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, and the elderly. Hunger is the problem; food is the remedy.</p>

<p>An important first step in making available food assistance to all who needed it when, in 1974, Congress extended the Food Stamp Program to cover all those eligible for help in the entire U.S. Other programs have been added and liberalized. They have made a significant difference in the nutritional and health status of people they have reached. We can document decreases in illnesses, in infant and maternal deaths, and in the incidence of iron deficiency and anemia. Carefully controlled studies in a poor population have revealed that a 15 percent increase in dietary energy during pregnancy and the early months of infancy produced larger children who demonstrated improved learning ability over a population who had not received dietary supplement. The children evidenced improved growth, increased head circumference, and a decreased incidence of nutritional anemia. These are important measures of improved health.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the existing food programs, either singly or together, has proved sufficient to deal with the problem of hunger. 'Me programs are administratively clumsy, often demean people, and have never reached more than 60 percent of the people in need of help. Due to bureaucratic ineptness, hostility to the programs by local political leadership, and the lack of will on the part of the U.S.D.A. to see that the programs serve all who are eligible, - participation in these programs is actually decreasing all over the nation during a time when food prices are rising and the need for the program is greater than ever. What is needed is a system that will deliver food in adequate amounts to people who need it. I know of no proposal that will accomplish that objective short of a full employment program that guarantees a job with adequate pay to every person who wants to work and this must be supplemented by financial assistance at a realistic and humane level to those who, for a variety of reasons, cannot work and do not have money to buy enough food.</p>

<p>In the absence of a national policy of full employment, the new Food Stamp law, now being implemented, represents an unparalleled opportunity to assure an adequate diet for all needy Americans. There is no necessity for apology or defensiveness, for the program does more to lengthen and strengthen the lives of disadvantaged Americans than any other noncategorical social program. It is virtually the only government aid offered to the working poor.</p>

<p>This is a matter of self-interest. The social costs of 30 million poor and near poor in our midst are enormous, primarily in terms of the loss of human potential, lost forever to malnutrition and secondarily, in terms of operating expenses wasted in the support of battalions of caretakers.</p>

<p>But there is another side to this coin. In this overfed country, it is almost foolish to ask whether hunger has serious consequences. Surely, even a negative answer would not lead us to conclude that it is all right for people to remain unnecessarily hungry. The reason for feeding disadvantaged children and their families in the richest country the world has ever know is because they are hungry.</p>

<p>Arnold Toynbee once said "I do not believe the greatest threat to our civilization is from bombs or guided missiles. I don't think our civilization will die that way. I think it will die when we no longer care."</p>

<p>My assumption is that we do care and my hope is that we shall find
the wisdom and the will to eliminate poverty from this nation and
there will no longer exist the necessity for a food stamp program.</p>
