Will The Circle Be Unbroken?:
An Audio Resource for Schools and
Communities to Increase Racial Understanding
The radio series Will The Circle be Unbroken? provides an effective resource for promoting understanding of civil rights history and the importance of continued work for racial equality. Some formats for broadening the ongoing dialogue about race relations in the U.S. include:

•	Sponsoring listening events with a local radio station on an evening or evenings of the series' broadcast.

•	collecting and publicizing (through broadcast and print media) interviews with the local, "unsung he-roes" of the civil rights movement.

•	sponsoring a "radio club" (like a book club) to engage in regular discussion based on the series.

•	hosting a panel discussion about the civil rights history and the status of race relations in your community today featuring civic leaders and movement veterans.

•	organizing an essay or art contest on race relations with young people or adults. Sample topics include: What did the civil rights movement achieve? Is it still needed today? What is the most pressing race-related issue confronting your community today and what should we do to address it?

•	providing a forum for students (or adults) to discuss experiences with prejudice.

•	building partnerships with local civil rights groups, schools, churches, unions, civic groups, PTA, and fraternal organizations, to co-sponsor some of the events mentioned above and to study and work to end present-day disparities.

•	volunteering with local groups and organizations that actively confront prejudice and discrimination (see below to receive a list from SRC).

Individuals can also make copies of the series avail-able to local educators to use in the classroom (the first and last programs of the series—"Prologue" and "Epilogue," written by Julian Bond— would be particularly useful in the classroom).
Useful curriculum guides are available, such as Actions Speak Louder: A Skills Based Curriculum For Building Inclusion by the National Conference, a human relations organization dedicated to fighting bias, bigotry and racism. If you would like to find out how you can receive the entire curriculum, call (800) 352-6225 or write them at The National Conference, 71 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10003.
ONLINE OUTREACH
The Southern Regional Council has launched a special site on the World Wide Web (http:// unbrokencircle.org) for the series, linked to our main site www.src.wl.com.
As a forum for ongoing discussion, the site serves as a way for individuals, educators, civil rights organizations, radio listeners, public radio stations and others to share, interact and learn about issues relating to civil rights in ways that are relevant to daily life. It includes: program transcripts, a moderated on-line discussion group, a comprehensive bibliography, listeners guide to the music heard in the series, an annotated list of civil rights organizations nationwide, a list of civil rights museum sites and oral history centers, and links to scores of civil rights organizations' web sites, radio stations airing the series and other on-line resources.
If you are planning a listener activity for students or adults , SRC has scripted ideas for groups and resource lists to share, send email to info Q unbrokencircle.org or send a $3.00 check or money order for postage and handling made out to Southern Regional Council to:
