Worth Noting

Black Political Participation as America Enters its Third Century, Yoriko Nakajima (Chudh University Press, Tokyo, 1989, xiv, 369 pages)

Note by LESLIE DUNBAR

The above title is an English translation (supplied by the author). Few of us can read the book, and can only be appreciative of its appearance in Japan. But for readers of Southern Changes, added interest comes from the fact that studying at the Southern Regional Council in the early 1960's, Professor Nakajima, who teaches about the United States, began her familiarity with 'black political participation".

She acknowledges that in her introduction, where the names of good friends of the Council-Grace Hamilton, Clarence Bacote, Spelman College and Atlanta University, Julian Bond, Andrew Young, John Lewis-also appear in acknowledgment. The chapters range from (an English translation of the Table of Contents is supplied) 'problems that the turbulent South faced in 1961" to 
"transformation of American political system."
