<argument>Harvey Gates, a columnist for the <hi rend="italic>Atlanta Voice Newspaper</hi>, was the director of the Civil Agression Study Team at the Center for Research and Social Change at Emory University from 1966-69.</argument>

<p>In the September issue of Southern Changes, Mr. Robert P. Hilldrup struck a cord sensitive to my paternal instincts with his article entitled: "My Sons Are Growing Up Racists."</p>

<p>His concern has wider implications than the family hearth. As a writer and father I feel compelled to respond, in my own way, to his comments because I am also concerned about the attitudes my Black sons will take in race relations.</p>

<p>We are both fathers looking at the same coin from different sides. However, I do not think our responsibilities as parents can be paralleled. We can both teach our children to respect mankind and all other objects and creatures in this universe, but his children will have to develop tolerance, indeed love, for Blacks from their vantage of power. My boys will have to develop the same sentiments from their point of powerlessness.</p>

<p>From my point of view, this makes his task easier. He can tell his boys that school is an institution in society that can be used for their benefit and he will not be hard put to think of examples.</p>

<p>He can tell them that in spite of affirmative action policies they will still have about 80 percent of the pie. He can tell them that the sacrifice he is making, buying their lunches, clothes, school supplies, etc., will be more than vindicated by the disparities between what my Black sons will earn and what they will earn. Finally, he can tell them that if they are not satisfied with their present arrangements he and their mother have it within their power to forget about their pursuit of justice and equality and move on like the rest of his White brothers.</p>

<p>I do not have these options to present my sons. They are part of a different army. They must march to the beat of a different drum. They must answer the call of a different bugler.</p>

<p>For a long time, we were separated in the South. We were separated
by the proverbial railroad tracks, but this was just a physical
manifestation of a larger and deeper separation. Whites and Blacks did
not touch each other in any real or meaningful ways. We did not shake hands. We denied each other the basic civilities ordinarily accorded fellow human beings. We were, in the main, just objects to each other.</p>

<p>We did interact on a personal level and some of these interactions,
despite their limitation (master and servant relationship), developed
into genuine relationships. They became more than a mutually dependent
arrangement. They went as deep as the feelings and sensitivities of the participants would permit. However, these were personal, single, individual relationships, and were not transmittable to progenitors, friends and fellow members of the race.</p>

<p>For example, when I was a member of a team studying racial violence in the 1960s, it was not uncommon for a Black or White participant in hand-to-hand combat to take time out and go to the rescue of a friend on the opposing team. I have seen instances of groups of Blacks cordoning off their favorite store in the community during uprisings to prevent any harm to the White proprietor and his property. These are some of the manifestations of the deeper personal relationships.</p>

<p>Our moral commitments are no deeper than our moral convictions. Our convictions are no deeper than our perceptions of ourselves and others. Before we can have the capacity for empathy we must understand the needs of others in terms of our own feelings, emotions and desires. White people and Black people have not arrived en masse at this level, nor has any other group where artificial barriers have existed for long periods of time.</p>

<p>When the word White is mentioned, Blacks get an image of the repressive machine which has by definition, legally and morally, treated them as less than a fellow human being.</p>

<p>This is true for the old and young alike (in both races). This is
why my sons and Mr. Hilidrup's sons will have friends on the personal
level, but will be enemies on the group or institutional level. Until
integration reaches the plateau of feeling and commitment found in
these personal relationships, we are using words that have no real
meanings. Our schools, shops, jobs and governments are no more
integrated today than they were a century ago. We are just operating
under the same roof.</p>

<p>Contrary to what is generally expressed, the greatest violence against Black people has not been the lash of the whip in slavery nor the pummelling of their bodies by negrophobes. The greatest violence that has been perpetrated on Black people has been White people's indifference to their humanness.</p>

<p>Whiplashes heal and the scars are soon no more than timely reminders, but the injured spirit lives on and on as if transmitted through the genes. The responsibility of this condition cannot be attributed to any generation for it is the cumulative effect of the deeds of all generations.</p>

<p>Justice and equality for all is a costly pursuit. There are some people hi the world who do not care about the cost of anything as long as they are not the ones who have to pay the price. These persons offer lip service to a cause, but they will not spend a modicum of energy, or for that matter, suffer a moderate inconvenience for its fruition.</p>

<p>Anyone who would take up the Black people's cross in this country will not have an easy time of it. They will find themselves often at odds with some of the basic institutions in society, not the least of which is the family.</p>

<p>It has never been clear to this country how she can live up to her
tenets as outlined in the Declaration of Inde-
<pb n="4"/>
pendence (which does not have the force of law), and to the federal Constitution (which does have the force of law), without first improving the lot of the American Blacks.</p>

<p>Moreover, this task is further complicated when the plight of
Blacks has to be improved without injury to Whites. This is the enigma
our sons must face. My sons want justice and equality now. They
deserve it and they can be accorded no less if they are still to be
considered Americans. Hilldrup's sons want the same thing. They also
deserve it. Justice and equality should never have been a racial issue, but it has been and still is in this country. This is what forces our sons, Black and White, to be intolerant.</p>

<p>Hilldrup's sons do not know what it means to be denied justice and
equality because of race. So while I can appreciate Hilldrup's concern
about his sons' racial attitudes, I can only sympathize with his
plight. We are both, as parents, rowing in a sea of confusion, which
one Swedish sociologist has called the "American Dilemma." We do not
know the answer. We may not have even asked the right questions yet,
but Mr. Hilldrup is at least headed in the right direction. I take his
comments seriously. Of course, neither of us will come up with a
solution, but we are both concerned parents and on this score, at
least, we are ahead of most of the others.</p>

<head>The Courtesy of Becoming a Federal Judge</head>
<docAuthor>By Steve Suitts</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 1, No. 2, 1978, pp. 6,7,23</docDate>

<p>As a moderate segregationist governor of Mississippi, James P. Coleman once advised his supporters resisting integration that "any legislature can pass an act faster than the Supreme Court can erase it." As time showed, the strategy was partially effective since racial integration began to seep into Mississippi only after being confronted with civil rights legislation, an angry president, and federal court decisions. The governor's own course, however, may have had a more lasting effect. He retired from office, was appointed to a federal judgeship, and now sits on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Judge Coleman and his brethren on the Fifth Circuit will soon be joined by several others when the president announces the appointment of the 60 district and circuit judges who will be added to the federal bench in the South. Because of recent legislation, more than 150 new federal judges will be appointed throughout the nation. Never before have so many federal judges been appointed at one time.</p>

<p>Although no one, including the president, knows exactly who will fill all these positions, there is clearly a moral obligation for him to appoint a large number of qualified Blacks and women. As a recent report of the Southern Regional Council revealed, the federal court system in the South has only one Black federal judge out of more than 130. Only one Black is a U.S. attorney and only three are U.S. marshals in Southern states. No Black is a full-time magistrate or chief clerk. Overall, no more than six percent of the entire personnel of the federal courts in the South is Black - an increase of only four percentage points since 1965.</p>

<p>While women are represented in large numbers, mostly in secretarial and clerical positions, they hold few positions of responsibility. Only one woman is a federal judge in the South. There is no female U.S. attorney or U.S. marshal and in all professional positions in the Southern district courts, women hold only 9 percent of them.</p>

<p>These facts alone ought to insure that a large number of Blacks and women will be appointed; however, the same moral imperatives and striking facts existed in 1965, when not a year after signing the Civil Rights Act, President Lyndon Johnson submitted the name of James P. Coleman to be a federal judge.</p>

<p>Judge Coleman's appointment angered almost every civil rights activist, many of whom testified against his appointment before the U.S. Senate committee. In opposing Coleman's nomination, Martin Luther King, Jr. expressed his own puzzlement about how the president could nominate a man who was "the architect of the Mississippi plan to circumvent the orders of the very court to which he now seeks appointment." Despite their anger, most Southern civil rights lawyers were not surprised. They knew of that peculiar process now, in gentlemanly terms, as "senatorial courtesy."</p>

<p>Despite the Constitutional provision that the president shall appoint and the Senate shall confirm nominees to the federal bench, the process usually works with the roles reversed. One or two senators from a state select the nominee, the president confirms him, and the Senate seals the bargain. Thus, in reality, it was the powerful senators from Mississippi - not Lyndon Johnson - who made Coleman a federal judge.</p>

<p>The process of judicial selection is pure patronage and works like this: a senator from the state where the nominee will serve selects the person and informs the president. After a background check by the F.B.I. and review by the Bar Association's committee, the president usually submits the name of the nominee to the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee, in turn, returns the name to the senator asking permission, in effect, to conduct hearings. If the nominee is the same person the senator originally nominated, the committee holds hearings and votes on whether to confirm. If the senator's selection was not forwarded by the president, he usually has an opportunity to kill the nomination.</p>

<p>While the process varies from time to time, the motivating element in the selection is always political favoritism and was recently described by Attorney General Bell, who became a federal judge of the Fifth Circuit in the Kennedy administration. "Becoming a federal judge wasn't very, difficult," Bell says. "I managed John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in Georgia. Two of my oldest friends were the two senators from Georgia. And I was campaign manager and special, unpaid counsel for the governor."</p>

<p>Under this system, it is obviously easier to explain an appointment to the federal bench by looking at the local politics and the state's two U. S. senators than by reading the president's announcement of the nomination. Certainly, it would have been hard otherwise to figure out how President Kennedy appointed Harold Cox, a vocal segregationist who after taking office once referred to Blacks as "chimpanzees," and how President Johnson could have come up with Coleman as his first choice.</p>

<p>As the system has always operated, the further a judgeship is
removed<pb n="7"/> from one particular state, the less senatorial courtesy is observed. The appointment of district courts judges whose jurisdiction is confined to one state have always been viewed as the exclusive property of the U. S. senators from that state. While the same process applies to judgeships of the circuit courts (since retiring judges are usually replaced by someone from the same state), a president has greater opportunity to exercise his own judgment on these. Positions on the Supreme Court have never been subject to the usual senatorial courtesy although many Supreme Court justices sat on lower courts and were selected to those positions by the usual process.</p>

<p>Like others, this system of patronage works efficiently-just not fairly. For Southern Blacks and women, the process is as exclusionary as some of the most disingenuous Jim Crow laws.</p>

<p>Most Southern Black lawyers have been involved since their days in law school with supporting legal battles against local state and White politicians. They've opposed in court most of the important legislation and political chicanery which Southern Whites attempted to maintain for their own survival. Obviously, these lawyers are seldom the individuals who are first in line for patronage from the South's delegation to the U. S. Senate.</p>

<p>Many women lawyers, also, have fought hard against local White politicians in the South, and just as often others simply are not counted as vital for any political support. In both, few women lawyers have claim to enough political patronage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the system has not opened up even when the old patricians of Southern life have been replaced with more progressive Southerners. Often, the usual course of least resistance for these newer senators has been to avoid local opposition to the appointment of a Black or a woman. Usually concerned not to show themselves as "too liberal" these senators prefer less visible means of supporting Black and women constituents.</p>

<p>The only Black federal judge in the South, Robert Collins, who was appointed in July to a Louisiana district court, has the necessary training and experience to be a federal judge. He also had the real qualifications! He was very active and influential in successful campaigns for Louisiana's statewide officeholders. Few of his Black colleagues in the bar across the South hold such a unique position.</p>

<p>The political power of Blacks simply isn't strong enough to influence many appointments. In no Southern state has a Black been able to be elected to a major statewide office. While Black voters are significant in some statewide races, they don't have the numbers or the political clout in any one state to demand that Black lawyers be well represented in that line of people waiting for their political dole. With emerging voting patterns where Blacks no longer vote solidly for only one White candidate in Southern statewide elections, chances of Black leaders competing successfully for their fair share of patronage will decline.</p>

<p>Two years ago another former governor from the South, Jimmy Carter, ran for president and pledged to rid the selection of federal judges of political patronage and to make appointments only on the basis of merit. While the president has not attempted to alter the process of selecting district judges, the heart of the patronage system, he has established for each appeals court a commission which gathers nominations and make recommendations. There are also other proposals presently before Congress which would break up the old system. Some already operate in such places as Florida where the state's senators agreed voluntarily to alter senatorial courtesy. Although each plan differs, all have a "bi-partisan commission" which makes recommendations to the president and the senators.</p>

<p>It is not clear how far these new procedures move the selection away from patronage. For instance, there is little difference between the selection of a judge by a commission filled with the political cronies of a U. S. senator and the senator's own selection. Also, there's evidence that some of the commissions include a Black or woman in their several recommendations merely for appearance, knowing that someone else will always be selected. In any event, none of these commissions operating in the South has produced a Black or woman judge.</p>

<p>The standard set by these bi-partisan commissions may also have the same effect as the patronage system. For instance, some commissions have been requiring that a person have 15 years trial experience as a lawyer to be eligible for consideration. Although justified in the name of competence, the standard simply excludes an overwhelming number of Black and women lawyers in the South.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago when Southern governors were fighting to keep Blacks out of state schools, including law schools, Blacks had to travel north to get a legal education and afterwards few could practice in Southern states since they were largely excluded from the bar associations. A requirement for 15 years' trial experience as a lawyer is as exclusionary for Southern Blacks as the rule, once enforced in the South, that graduates from the state law school, where Blacks were prohibited, can automatically qualify to practice law.</p>

<p>Women in the South and elsewhere have faced similar obstacles. Because of social standards and law school admission practices, few women became lawyers before the 1960's. Those who did graduate found it difficult as a lawyer to get actual trial experience. Judges, lawyers, and even clients often held the view that women could not competently handle a trial, and in large law firms women were seldom assigned to trial work. While she may be brilliant, she usually doesn't have much trial experience.</p>

<p>By patronage or sham professionalism, the system of appointing
judges<pb n="23"/> must not be allowed to exclude Blacks and women from the federal bench and to deny litigants the benefit of their additional experience, insight, and knowledge. The President and the Senate not only must abandon the system of patronage but also must recognize the unique opportunity in which the federal courts of the South and the nation can now be integrated. There probably will not be another chance in the next century to redress so well the many years of denied opportunities.</p>

<p>Yet, the old ways of patronage will not be withdrawn easily. In 1965, when civil rights had its greatest force in the U. S. Congress, judge Coleman's appointment was opposed by no more than eight U. S. senators- a number which did not include many liberals such as Robert Kennedy. More recently, president Carter, has also been unwilling to confront the Senate's patronage of appointments for district judges or to insure that the selection process includes Blacks and women.</p>

<p>Unless Southerners of good will devote time and energy to make the
changes happen, Blacks and women in large numbers will continue to be
denied this one "courtesy" and in future years we may all be searching
desperately for even a compromised strategy which can do half as well
as the one which suited Governor Coleman and his supporters years
ago.</p>

<head>Vivian Malone Jones and the VEP: From Integration to Voter Registration</head>
<docAuthor>By Christena Bledsoe</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 1, No. 2, 1978, pp. 8-10</docDate>
<argument>
<p>Christena Bledsoe, a former newspaper reporter, is a free-lance
writer living in Atlanta.</p>
</argument>

<p>Sometime in her youth, Vivian Malone Jones decided she wanted to go
to college. That wouldn't have been such an unusual decision except
that her family was poor. Her father was a laborer. She was one of
seven children. She lived in Alabama. It was the early 60s. And she
was Black.</p>

<p>"I just knew I was going to college," she says, her voice rising with
inflection as she remembers. "It was one of those things that - I just
knew."</p>

<p>It was 1961 and she was 18. She set her sights on becoming a certified
accountant. She applied to the University of Alabama and was told
"no," due to a crowded enrollment situation. An unspoken reason stood
out though. The school was all-White and accepting her would have
meant integrating the university where Alabama's well-bred White
families for generations had sent their young.</p>

<p>She was admitted to the state's Black school, Alabama A&M, where Alabama tradition said she belonged. She majored in business education, the closest available field to her career choice, and attended for two years. But she wasn't satisfied. She wanted more: she wanted to be able to pick the school where the education received would help accomplish her goals. She persisted in trying to get into the University of Alabama. She sought advice from NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York and two years later her admission was ordered by a court.</p>

<p>She was, however, throwing herself and her family into an emotionally charged, possibly dangerous situation. Several other Black students changed their minds about entering the university after a man who identified himself as a representative of the state of Alabama spoke to their families.</p>

<p>" 'You know,'" she recalls his words, "'there's going to be trouble here and we can't guarantee your child's safety under these conditions. Are you sure you want your child to go in there?'"</p>

<p>Her family believed she should stick with her plans. They received threatening phone calls and had police protection for six months. "But nobody ever bombed the house or burned a cross. That's pretty good considering," she says now.</p>

<p>The day finally arrived: June 11, 1963. She waited silently in a car, along with fellow would-be student James Hood, while U.S. Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach confronted Alabama Governor George Wallace. at the school door.</p>

<p>The TV cameras glowed, the pencil press recorded and the event became etched in the memories of Americans everywhere. It was a flamboyant extravaganza - some say staged so that Gov. Wallace could have his show - testifying that the South was reluctantly changing, that racial barriers were going to be broken and that doors to education and the social mainstream were opening for Southern Blacks.</p>

<p>As she sat in the car, she concentrated on how she would fare academically. "I was in. I knew that. I worried about maintaining grades with the pressure I anticipated would surround me." She decided to push fear out of her head. "You can't afford to let it dominate your thoughts. There are other things a lot more important that you need to think about as opposed to, 'My God, what happens if someone fires a shot?' You just don't deal with that kind of thing. If you really are that concerned about your physical safety and security, then it's probably not for you to be in a place like that."</p>

<p>Today Vivian Malone Jones finds herself part of the Southern legend of change, safely chronicled in the pages of history. She went on to become the first Black to graduate from the University of Alabama. From there she moved to Washington, D.C., where she became a research analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and later an employee relations specialist for the Veterans Administration's central office. While in Washington, she also pursued the M.S. Degree in Public Administration at George Washington University.</p>

<p>She keeps a front page clipping as a memento of her admittance to the University of Alabama in an office drawer, but at 36, she's too young to be content with memories from the past. Today she finds herself in a world swirled by the '60s promise of change that was never fulfilled.</p>

<p>Today Jones sits near a poster that proclaims, "Hands
<pb n="9"/>
that picked cotton now can pick our public officials," and discusses her work. She now is the executive director of the Voter Education Project, a non-profit corporation based in Atlanta that has striven to promote change through the political process.</p>

<p>She assumed the VEP directorship in August of 1977, after former director and civil rights figure John Lewis was appointed associate director of ACTION, the federal voluntary agency. She came to VEP after several years as director of the Civil Rights and Urban Affairs Division for the Environmental Protection Agency. Widely acclaimed for its work, VEP, which began as a special project of the Southern Regional Council but became a separate entity in 1970, has assisted the voter registration of almost 3 million Blacks throughout the South.</p>

<p>The Black vote now counts. In 1976, Black voters, particularly in states like Mississippi, assured the election of the President. Just I1 years earlier, a U.S. president had used his office to secure passage of a Voting Rights Act designed to eliminate illegal barriers interfering with Black citizens' right to vote.</p>

<p>The turnabout sounds dramatic and is. It is also misleading. Southern Blacks are far from being full partners in the political process. Despite spectacular gains such as winning the majority of Atlanta and New Orleans, they are underrepresented at the statehouse level, in the county commission and city council chambers of the South and in the U.S. Congress as well.</p>

<p>VEP faces a massive job ahead if the majority of Southern Blacks ever are to register and exercise their right to vote, thereby shaping a political system responsive to their needs.</p>

<p>Right now those prospects don't look good. Statistically speaking, VEP's job is half-done at best. Millions of Southern Blacks have not taken advantage of the right to register to vote, perhaps three to four million in all.</p>

<p>"The problem that we're running into is that once you've registered all the people who are eager, willing, or at least the only thing they needed was a little motivation, then you get down to the hard-core group," explains Jones, a tall, poised woman with a collected air.</p>

<p>Youths, aged 18 to 25, constitute the largest number of unregistered Blacks. Their interests tend to be scattered and they see little reason to register or vote unless an issue specifically touches them.</p>

<p>In rural areas where older Blacks dominate, they often don't vote. "They've been accustomed to things as they were 15, 20 or 30 years ago and really see no hope for getting out of that situation."</p>

<p>Another problem is that many who registered earlier failed to vote. Their names have been purged from the polls. "We've got the age-old problem of educating people about why it's important to vote." VEP attempts to pass the word that in other similar communities Blacks registered and were able to put into office officials that represented their interests.</p>

<p>That, ultimately, says Jones, is what voter registration is about. It's a complicated task. It takes learning issues, learning which candidates represent your interests and lending campaign support.</p>

<p>"Once you've satisfied your basic needs of food, shelter and clothing you can concentrate on some of those more sophisticated areas. It's difficult to get someone to contribute even a dollar when they're looking for work," Jones assesses.</p>

<p>VEP provides funds and technical assistance to registration projects run by community groups, such as the NAACP or SCLC. The work is being hamstrung by inadequate finances. Like many non-profit corporations, VEP was dependent on foundation support that sharply dwindled in the mid-70s recession. Despite efforts to expand its financial base, VEP hasn't yet fully recovered. Its budget, a maximum of $457,000 this year if sought after funds are received, is half its early 70s size. Permanent staff has shrunk too. "We have to turn down maybe 12 requests for every one that we're able to fund."</p>

<p>Given the combination of complex field work and financial restrictions, Jones is reluctant to set a timetable for when most Southern Blacks will be registered. "I think we've done very well with what we've had," she responds. "We're dealing with large numbers of people who have never voted in their lives, their parents didn't vote. When you think about the political process and how long it's been in effect, then 16 years (VEP's existence) represents a very small period."</p>

<p>Among projects underway, VEP is funding a Florida project designed to register the handicapped and a pilot Georgia program, Project 23, the results of which later may be applied to other states.</p>

<p>Project 23 takes its name from the 23 Georgia counties where the majority of the population is Black. Most are located in middle and southwest Georgia, a few are spread elsewhere.</p>

<p>Many of the counties have no Black elected public officials. "If you've got a majority of 75 percent and 80 percent in some cases, and no Black elected officials, then something's wrong with the process. "It's like South Africa almost," she says, diminishing with a small laugh what to some might be an unpopular analogy.</p>

<p>What VEP has done is to go into the 23 counties and look
<pb n="10"/>
 for impediments that keep Blacks from registering or running for office. A commonly found situation was that of confining voter registration to the courthouse, despite the ready convenience of widely frequented sites such as grocery stores or shopping centers.</p>

<p>Often the hours set for registration were so restricted that Blacks had trouble taking advantage of them. VEP experienced difficulties also in getting deputy registrars appointed to assist the registration of Blacks. In a few instances, restrictions were extreme. Jones speaks of situations where registration was held in a White home and Blacks were told to enter at the back of the house. She also speaks of a "couple of cases" where ballots were marked so that it was known who voted for whom. "This can lead to intimidation if you don't vote for the right person.</p>

<p>A number of the counties now have expanded registration sites and hours and some elected officials more representative of the population. In one area, more than 99 percent of the Black populace has been registered. But problems remain. VEP frequently gets calls from area people concerned about "how the votes were counted or what happens to the ballots . . . As long as those kinds of things are still happening, we will continue Project 23."</p>

<p>As she views the South from the perspective of the 60s, Jones says she would have expected much more change.</p>

<p>She lives in a neighborhood undergoing transition from White to Black. This is the second neighborhood she has lived in where for-sale signs have appeared on White owned homes after Blacks began moving in. She expects her current Atlanta neighborhood to be 75 percent Black within a year. "I expected that by now people would not be running when Blacks moved into the neighborhood."</p>

<p>She expected that a system would have been developed by now which would have eliminated the poverty still affecting masses of Southern Blacks. In her field work, she looks around and often exclaims, "My God, this is just as it was when I was growing up."</p>

<p>She recalls a recent conversation with a Black neighbor that illustrates both a lack of change and a reluctance to push the status quo.</p>

<p>As a point of curiosity, she asked what the fee was for the nearly private country club. "The person I was talking to said, 'Oh, I've been wanting to join, but they don't allow Blacks to join.'</p>

<p>"I asked, 'Have you applied?'</p>

<p>"No, she hadn't.</p>

<p>"This is the same kind of mentality we're talking about when I talk about someone not going down to register or not running for office because 'Blacks don't do this.' "</p>

<p>Recent events, Proposition 13, the Bakke Supreme Court case, and decisions favoring the seniority system, disturb her.</p>

<p>"I think that some of the kinds of problems that are cropping up are the result of a settling process. It will be interesting to see which way these things go because I think it can set us back considerably if this trend continues." She believes the country will be in for "a lot of turmoil and disruption if that happens." She declines to speculate on the form of turmoil though, doubting that anyone could have predicted the riots of the 60s. She advocates protest through the ballot box. "That's when it is being used properly."</p>

<p>If change indeed occurs, what kind of society would she like to see it produce?</p>

<p>"If you're talking about the ultimate - what I consider to be the kind of situation where we'll say 'Yes, we've arrived and things are really great.' I think that's the time when people can truly move into society without the overriding factor being race or sex."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I'll ever see this in my lifetime. I really don't. I doubt it."</p>

<p>Nonetheless, she appears determined to work for change, as determined
as when she won the right to enter the University of Alabama. She notes that James Hood, who entered with her, recently said he would not go through the harrowing experience again.</p>

<p>"I feel just the opposite. If I had to do it again, I would. There is absolutely no question in my mind ... I couldn't accept that condition anymore today than I could back in 1961 when Wallace was saying I couldn't go to that school."</p>

<p>Atlanta may be "the city too busy to hate" but its process of desegregating its public school system reflects the trends of most communities in the South since the Brown decision in 1954. Between 1958 and 1973 five desegregation lawsuits were filed against school systems in metro Atlanta, and one is still pending in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Emma Armour v. Jack P. Nix</hi> has been referred to as the "Metro suit" because the city of Atlanta and six surrounding counties were first charged with segregation in public education. The Compromise Plan of 1973 which stemmed from an earlier case, <hi rend="italic">Calhoun v. Cook</hi>, was supposed to solve this problem; however, the proposed remedies did not significantly integrate the public schools. Roughly 20 all-White schools were integrated but the remaining Black schools, which were in the majority, were left untouched by the plan.</p>

<p>Several national leaders of the NAACP spoke out against the compromise which was created by the Board of Education of Atlanta and the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP. They charged that it violated national NAACP policy by leaving Black students in segregated schools. However, the plan was approved and busing of some 5,000 students to White schools occurred.</p>

<p>The Metro suit was filed in June of 1972 by parents who felt that their children were not receiving an adequate education in the Atlanta public schools. Mrs. Ethel Mathews, a plaintiff in the suit, said, "What we are searching for is equality for our children and the Metro suit is the only way to get it." The case was not presented before a judge until November 1977 because the court was awaiting the decision in a similiar case in Richmond, Va. During those 5 years some of the parents who had filed the suit moved from the city or had their children transferred to other schools within the area. Attorneys from the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) are representing the plaintiffs in the suit. They are seeking a metropolitan remedy whereby students would be transferred across city and county lines for the purpose of desegregating all the schools. A decision from the Court is likely by the end of 1978.</p>

<p>In the three days of hearings in November, the attorneys tried to prove that residential segregation exists in the metropolitan area and was deliberately created by actions of the State of Georgia operating through its governmental agencies. They presented evidence to support the fact that in 1924 the city of Atlanta created residential apartheid by enacting a zoning ordinance which designated the western corridor of Atlanta as a Black area. The North Avenue-Ponce de Leon "line" was also designated as a racial residential line, and the area north of this line was maintained for Whites only. Thus, schools remained segregated due to housing patterns created by government.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs further tried to establish the existence of a true metropolitan area. Their controversial, expert witness, Dr. Karl Taeuber, an urban sociologist, testified that "the Atlanta metropolitan area is an integrated social, economic and market area and the segregative actions of government in one portion of the area have and have had a segregative effect in all other portions of the area."</p>

<p>The defendants testimony was heard in March at which time the attorneys for the various school systems tried to get their clients dismissed from the case. Of the original 11 defendants, only four remain. The court ruled that there was an "absence of significant interdistrict effects" to warrant the inclusion of Clayton, Cobb, Douglas, and Gwinnett counties, and the cities of Buford, Decatur and Marietta in the suit. Only the city of Atlanta, Fulton county, and DeKalb county, and the state of Georgia remain defendants in the case.</p>

<p>However, recent findings by David Armor, a witness for the defendants, support the plaintiffs rationale for a metropolitan remedy. In a report entitled "White Flight, Demographic Transition and the Future of School Desegregation," he found that desegregation can cause accelerated White flight, particularly in larger school districts with substantial minority enrollment (20%) and in districts with accessible White suburbs. Armor showed that in Florida school districts where metropolitan desegregation plans are in effect, there is very little White flight to the suburbs as opposed to school districts where only inner-city desegregation is occuring.</p>

<p>Proposed remedies for desegregating the Atlanta area are a
significant part of the case; however, they were not allowed to be
introduced into the plaintiffs' testimony. At present under the
Compromise, a student can participate in a program called the Majority
to Minority (M&M) Program. He may choose to transfer from a school
where his race is in the majority to one where his race is in the
minority. These voluntary transfers are not working as effectively as
possible, however, because only Black students are choosing to go to
schools where their race is in the minority, and they are being put on
waiting lists to get into White schools that are supposed to
accommodate them because of this program.</p>

<p>Attorneys for the plaintiffs in Armour propose the creation of different types of schools which are ideally suited for an area such as Atlanta. Government management centers, health practice centers, design centers, linguistic skills centers, and an aviation center could all be implemented if a metropolitan remedy were ordered for Atlanta, Fulton County and DeKalb County.</p>

<p>"This is not a busing case," said Margie Hames, attorney for the plaintiffs. Alternatives to busing which could be implemented are expanded neighborhood schools, clustering schools, magnet schools, and the use of drop off schools by commuters from the suburbs.</p>

<p>The controlling law on metropolitan school desegregation is set forth in the Detroit, Wilmington, Del., and Louisville, Ky. cases. In the Wilmington case, <hi rend="italic">Evans v. Buchanon</hi>, originally filed in 1957, the majority opinion of the court required inter-district busing. The details of their desegregation plan have not been completely worked out, but it will probably have a bearing on Atlanta's plan should the court rule in favor of a metropolitan remedy.</p>

<p>Several factors make this suit controversial. For one thing, under
the Compromise plan, a new organizational structure of the school
system was created. Blacks were put into key administrative positions
for the first time. According to Dr. Barbara Jackson of Atlanta
University's School of Education, a metropolitan desegregation plan might dilute the hard-won power of Blacks in the Atlanta school system. Whites would likely become the majority decision-makers in a cross-country plan.</p>

<p>The recent trend of White movement back into the city is another factor that influences the character of the case. Presently, Atlanta has a majority Black population and the public schools are predominately Black. However, many young White families are moving into the city and want to send their children to public schools, thus decreasing the press for a metropolitan remedy.</p>

<p>The issue of morality is a concern. Dr. Benjamin Mays, president of the Atlanta Board of Education, testified for the defendants that Atlanta schools have done the job outlined for them by the court in the Compromise plan of 1973. He calls the suit a "money-making scheme by lawyers."</p>

<p>Whether the suit is a "money-making scheme" or not, it tries to
address issues which were not solved by the Compromise of 1973. In
this respect it is trying to promote change for the better and a
future for education in the South which is based on innovations in
learning rather than placement of bodies.</p>

<p>She had thought this would be the day, and all morning Luemer Plumley, whom her sisters call Dooty, sat on the porch watching and waiting.</p>

<p>She watched expectantly as the power company truck lurched up the rough mountain road and one of the men got out and climbed the pole and tinkered with the wires at the top. She watched as they went on up to the church and passed back down again. And still she waited, but they didn't return.</p>

<p>It was almost two o'clock in the afternoon when she finally broke her silence and spoke to her sister, Della.</p>

<p>"Deller, I just as well cook us some dinner," she said. "We're not a-goina git no power today."</p>

<p>"Well, Dooty," said Della, "is that what you wuz a-waitin' fer?"</p>

<p>With that, Luemer went into the rickety house and fired up the big wood cookstove in the tiny kitchen. She had dreaded it. It was a hot August day, and the heat in the kitchen was soon almost unbearable. On a similar day a couple of weeks earlier, the preacher had come to visit and found Luemer cooking dinner. She had looked at him and said, "If hell's any hotter than this little kitchen, I sure don't want to go there, do you?"</p>

<p>Besides, she had been looking forward to using her new stove. It
wasn't a new stove, actually, just a small, used electric range. It sat in the corner across from the wood stove, plugged up and ready, but powerless, and now Luemer would have to wait for another day to use it.</p>

<p>She guessed she could wait all right. After all, she had been waiting a good part of her life for electricity to come up Glassy Mountain.</p>

<p>"Been a-lookin' to git it up here fer 25 years and it didn't come," she said, "just till we got so old we can't enjoy it."</p>

<p>Glassy Mountain is in an area of Greenville County, South Carolina, known as the Dark Corner, once a notorious moonshining district on the North Carolina border. It had always been sparsely settled, mainly by Plumleys. It was one of the last mountain enclaves where electricity had not reached.</p>

<p>The poles came now, marching up the new road, a long, winding,
unpaved gash in the mountain, so steep and dangerous some mountain
people refused to use it and still drove the old road, rutted and
narrow, on the other side of the mountain. But others came up the new
road, people from towns and cities far distant. They came in cars and
trucks and jeeps, and some of them came carrying strange contraptions,
great wings that they strapped to themselves so that they could leap
off the cliffs at the top of the mountain and glide to landings on
Highway 11, far below.</p>
<hi rend="14"/>
<p>Back in the winter a jeep had come, filled with whooping people, sliding and spinning in the snow, pulling a sled wildly behind, and just in front of the house, a man had come flying headover-heels out of the jeep and landed on the bank in front of the house with a sickening thud. The jeep had gone on and left him, and Luemer and her sister watched, terrified, from behind the door as he struggled, cursing, in the ditch.</p>

<p>"Every time he'd git up, he'd take the longest pause you've ever seen," Luemer would say, recalling the scene, "then he'd go back down again."</p>

<p>Finally, the jeep had returned, and the occupants got out and snatched up the man and strapped him across the hood, tied like a trophy deer, and then the jeep careened off down the mountain. The next morning, when Luemer listened to the news on the battery radio and heard a man had been found murdered in a ditch, she was sure it was that man she had watched struggling in the ditch.</p>

<p>Such goings-on the sisters had never seen before, but they had become a regular thing since the new road had come. "All the time," Luemer said. "It's a sight. It's awful." It had caused her to start keeping a gun close at hand. "No sir, they better not git off that road out there," she said. "I'm not a'goina fool with them ol' drunkards."</p>

<p>For most of their lives, the sisters' isolation on Glassy Mountain had been rarely infringed. There were only three of them now. There had been four until April, when Ellen, the youngest, the talkative one, died in a hospital. Mattie, too, had been in the hospital recently. The oldest at 78, she was staying with her son, off the mountain.</p>

<p>Only Della, 75, and Luemer, 67, remained at the old homeplace. Of the two, only Luemer had never left. Della had married and gone off down the mountain for 21 years until her husband died in 1957, when she returned. Luemer never saw any reason for marrying or leaving the mountain.</p>

<p>There had been 10 of them - five boys and five girls when they moved to this house in 1919 from another house on the mountain. It was an old house even then, built around a log cabin. Their father died the year after they moved in, and through the years, the sisters watched the others go one by one. Their mother died in the house in 1946. "She laid and prayed all the time for her grandchildren to come home from the Army," Luemer said, "and just as soon as the last one come home, she died."</p>

<p>In all those years, neither the house nor the sisters' way of living had changed very much. They still cooked on the woodstove, fetched water from the spring, read by the light of oil lamps, plowed their garden with the help of a mule. Chickens and guinea hens scratched in the bare front yard as they always had, and hounds still lounged under the front porch. Luemer would allow no cats in the house, no dogs on the porch.</p>

<p>But then the new road had come, bringing people and trouble from
distant places, and finally the electric hues had followed (although
not until the sisters, and their nephew down the road, and the small
church up
<pb n="15"/>
the hill had paid $1,500 each to the electric co-operative), and now Luemer knew things would never again be the s neon Glassy Mountain. She had already heard that people from Greenville were coming to build vacation homes nearby.</p>

<p>Even after Luemer and Della had paid the money to bring the electric lines to their house, it had looked for a while as if they might not get electricity after all. The house had to be wired. An electrician showed up one day and told her it would cost $2,000 to do the job, but the sisters didn't have any money left.</p>

<p>Then Jim Tankersley heard about it. He lives in River Falls, not far from Glassy Mountain. He knows the mountain and the people who live on it well. For more than 25 years, Jim Tankersley was a federal agent, a revenuer, one of the government's top still-busters. He has always been close to the people in the area. He came up the mountain with a friend from Greenville, Shorty Vaughn, and they wired the house at no charge. Not long afterward, Shorty came back bringing the electric range.</p>

<p>"He said he'd fetch a Kelvinator refrigerator next Sunday or the next," Luemer said. "I wouldn't have had lights atall if it hadn't been for keepin' us milk. I told 'em all along I didn't care about power. But we love our milk and butter, and you can't keep it in this heat."</p>

<p>Luemer didn't know what the holdup was about for getting the power on. She'd thought the men might come back after dinner, but a storm came instead. It brought sharp lightning and heavy black clouds that sent water rushing down the gullies on the road, "a real field soaker," Luemer called it.</p>

<p>When it was over, she and Della sat on the porch with visitors, enjoying the freshness and coolness the rain had brought.</p>

<p>Luemer told about laying in wait in the chickenho use for a black snake that was stealing her eggs and finding nine unbroken eggs inside it when she killed it. Della, a thin, frail woman, told how she swells so bad and never feels good anymore and has to go to bed before dark every day.</p>

<p>The subject of television came up. Luemer laughed when she was asked if she'd ever watched TV. "I've not watched one enough for my head to stop swimmin'. Only time I ever watched one was Billy Graham, that big preacher, and ever' time I was about to git interested, they cut 'im off."</p>

<p>"Would you watch it if you had one?" she was asked.</p>

<p>"I guess everybody does, I would too."</p>

<p>Two chickens got into a dispute over something one of them had scratched up in the yard. The dogs came out from under the porch where Della had shooed them and loped off toward the road.</p>

<p>"They goin' now to hunt a squirrel," Della said.</p>

<p>Somebody mentioned how nice and cool and quiet it was on the
mountain now, and Luemer looked at the electric lines that still
dangled, unconnected on the side of the house and said she expected
that surely the men would come tomorrow and cut on the power so she
wouldn't have to put up with that hot kitchen again.</p>
