Voting rights denied

By the editors.

George Bush celebrated the July 4th weekend this year with the most flagrantly anti-democratic act of his presidency-the veto of the National Voter Registration Act. The bill, which passed both houses of Congress with wide but not veto-proof margins, would have increased voter rolls from a disappointing 60 percent to an estimated 90 percent of eligible voters. With this Presidential exercise in arrogance, supporters of the legislation are left for the time being with the arduous but essential campaign to improve voter registration laws state-by-state.

Bush's veto should be seen for what it is-a partisan Republican strategy to limit the franchise and deny access to the voting booth. In a year of growing citizen rebelliousness against the privileges of public officeholders, our chief public official fears-as he well should-an expanded electorate, though the bill would not take effect until after the 1992 elections.

The President's terse veto message inexplicably cites "no justification" for the bill, though seventy million Americans remain unregistered. He rehashes fraud and corruption arguments but, as always, with no substantiating evidence. In fact, the twenty-nine states that register voters at motor vehicle bureaus and the twentyseven states that allow registration by mail, have found no cheating.

Bush further cites "unnecessary, burdensome, expensive and constitutionally questionable federal regulation," but what more constitutionally protected activity for government could there be than insuring citizen
participation? It is here that Bush reveals what is the real heart of Republican aversion to the bill-what is radical about this bill It makes voter registration an official function of the state.

With the slogans of democracy on its lips, the United States intervenes around theworld. Yet the U.S. ranks last of twenty major industrialized nations in voter participation-the only one where the burden of participation is on the citizen.

The bill's nickname, the "motor voter" bill, while handy, does a disservice, for this legislation would have gone much further than enlisting people with automobiles. Not only would the National Voter Registration Act have automatically registered drivers' license applicants, it would have required employees in public assistance, unemployment compensation, and offices serving the disabled to register voters. It would have encouraged the creation of additional registration sites. It would have provided for registration by mail in federal elections. Registered voters would have stayed registered, ending wholesale purges so effectively used to control the outcome of Southern elections.

The results, extrapolating from states which already apply these methods, would have been dramatic (see graph on page 3).

The National Voter Registration Act would have lent even greater significance to the struggle for power by disfranchised voters than the sheer numbers of new registrants. The legislation would have re-created a state obligation to register voters, shifting the authority for voter registration from the fiefdoms of county registrars to a matter of state responsibility.

That obligation was abdicated as early as 1944, when

the all-white primaries were ended as a result of Smith v. Allwright.

With the effects of Smith, states looked for new ways to prevent the franchise from being used by black voters. "Every voter registration officer is a law unto himself," said political scientist V.0. Key, in his 1949 book, Southern Politics. To shield their mischief from scrutiny, states stopped keeping reliable records ab out voter registration, especially by race. Even now, some major Southern states, like Florida, Mississippi, and Texas, have no state recordkeeping system for voters.

When the states stopped, the Southern Regional Council started, painstakingly documenting county by county, compiling and publishing the estimates of voter registration by race in the Southern states, in order to prove that, despite the claims of most Southern white politicians, blacks could not register and vote in the South.

Under the leadership of Wiley Branton, Vernon Jordan, and John Lewis, the Voter Education Project was
established as a special project of the Southern Regional . . Council from 1962 until 1972 to show how registration alority rican American could happen.
