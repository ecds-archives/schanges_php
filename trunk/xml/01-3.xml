<argument>
<p>Leslie Dunbar is presently on leave from his duties as executive director of the Field Foundation in New York City. He is a former director of the Southern Regional Council and the author of several articles and A Republic of Equals published in 1966.</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Last year Leslie Dunbar gave the major address at the annual meeting of the Southern Regional Council. This piece is adapted from that speech.</p>
</argument>

<p>In the closing months of the pre-atomic age, the Southern Regional Council was formed out of conviction that race was the central issue of the South. Though it may seem to us that nearly all else has changed during the hectic decades since, I doubt that race has yet yielded its place, though the problems it shapes and propels grow in their own various ways.</p>

<p>Nor has it yielded its place of primary importance elsewhere in the world. Even our own attention these days is more concentrated on the grim racial conflicts of southern Africa than on the still harsh relationships here. In truth, though, we can see that it is all one continuing struggle of mankind to free itself from a wrong turning it somehow made dark centuries ago, into the sadness, sickness and cruelty of racial pride.</p>

<p>There have been political revolutions that have blazed outward all over the world because they seemed to express noble ideals as well as partisan interests. One thinks, principally, of the American, the French, and the Russian Revolutions of modern times. I expect generations to come may see the Civil Rights revolt as like them, as America's second sending forth of impulses toward freedom to enchained peoples. I don't believe it is fanciful to see the road from Selma turning now toward Pretoria.</p>

<p>To say that is, of course, not to say that we stand on the edge of happiness. Twelve years after Selma we certainly don't have freedom in any satisfying measure, and in some important ways, it sometimes seems to me, we are worse off. I have worked and lived most of the last 12 years in the New York area, and as far as I can judge, the conditions of Black and Puerto Rican poor (and most Blacks and Puerto Ricans are poor, or close to being so) have worsened by almost any measure one selects, whether it is political power, housing, employment, or schools. Indeed, when one considers the vast changes within the South and then looks at the conditions of the urban poor of the North, it is as if they, almost alone, sacrificed for the progress of others.</p>

<p>There have been other kinds of setbacks as well. We have traded in the, perhaps impossible, dreams of the sixties, and accepted meaner ideals in return. And, saddest of all, the grave has had its victory. We lost Martin Luther King Jr., and George Wallace survives. We gave up Medgar Evers, but Jim Eastland will run again and likely win. Robert Kennedy was killed, and Richard Nixon ruled. Whitney Young and Audrey and Stephen Currier drowned, but red-lining bankers and self-protective foundation boards go on as before, controlling the money. George Wiley drowned too, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan prospered. Walter Reuther; that man who always wanted labor to connect with humanity's call, crashed to his death, while Frank Fitzsimmons, who wants only to connect with dollars, was becoming the single most powerful labor leader. These were crushing losses, and yet, unreplaced. There were others as well. Has any nation or cause ever lost so many of its natural leaders in such a short time?</p>

<p>Indeed when one looks back on the shining values of a dozen years ago and compares them with what columnist Bill Raspberry in the Chicago Sun Times correctly called the "situation ethics" of contemporary politics, what can we do but weep, or rage? What instructions about political morality are we supposed to receive when a month ago the Senate celebrated Messrs. Eastland and Stennis for their 30 years of joint membership in that body, three decades in which they have powerfully opposed just about any and every move toward human rights, justice for the weak and peace for the world. From the White House, Mr. Carter wished those men "many more years of dedicated service." Surrounded by capers and cut-ups like this, one can only wonder if we are supposed to take politics seriously? Are we all expected to fall into the game, chanting I'm 0. K., you're 0. K., Eastland and Stennis are 0. K., Helms is 0. K., Nixon too; the Vietnam War and all who made it-and especially those among its makers now called back to serve a Democratic president-, they're 0. K. too.</p>

<p>All of this is done in the name of political realism, but I no longer can believe in that. Somehow down those winding roads of so-called realism, the poor of this and foreign nations as well always seem to stay poor. The wars and preparations for war ceaselessly plod on, and the owners of the world's and our nation's wealth go on owning it. John Lewis had it almost correct when he went up to Vanderbilt back in 1968 while still a staff member of the Southern Regional Council. In a speech titled "Human Rights-A Final Appeal to the Church" he pronounced "Woe unto the political leaders who listen to the voices of expediency and act in the interests of a Great Consensus, rather than do what is right." Almost correct, because most of the woe, at least so far as we can see, falls not on the political leaders but on those they lead.</p>

<p>Let us confess, in honesty and fairness toward ourselves, that the
ideals of the early sixties were perhaps too<pb n="4"/>
high and hard, that the hopes for nonviolence and the "beloved community" lie beyond us. Let us accept that, let that be our "realism," even though any of you who share with me the good luck of knowing personally any of the heroes of South Africa, many of whom are now banned, will have to add that those same impossible ideals are moving people there as they once did here. Nevertheless, let us come down from the mountain, a bit. We do not need to come down so far.</p>

<p>The Southern Regional Council, along with the rest of the Civil Rights movement, has trusted in and practiced the methods of education, enlightened propaganda, political empowerment, and economic pressures of one kind or another. There have been at least two other methods. They were the methods of making friendships across racial lines and, to use a recent term, consciousness-raising. We need more of both today. It is too bad that the state and local councils on human relations have been allowed to decline. We need them, or their spirit, for the South is now as it was, a region where human relations, both bad and good but too often the former, weave the fabric of social life.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that, despite desegregation, there is almost less racial contact today than a decade ago. I have to admit that most of my own Black friends are ones I've known for a long time, and I suspect that too many other liberals, Black and White, might have to concede the same. We need to learn again why we used to like each other. So let us not be wholly preoccupied with "doing." Let us give more time to "being" with each other, and in each other's hopes and needs.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think the estrangement I sense is more the responsibility of Blacks than Whites, and the bridging of it will have to depend more on Blacks. There is a historical reason for that. At various points during the 1950s, it became clear that despite the loving and tireless effort of many good and even some great White Southerners, their leadership would not succeed. The reform of the South passed then to Black leadership. The greatest of Black leaders, Martin King, and others such as George Wiley knew how important it was that Black goals be linked with all those of democracy and peace. Their appeal was always to the nation as a whole to fulfill its Constitution, its principles, to become in its own interest transformed.</p>

<p>It is tempting today for Black leaders, rightfully impatient with the pace of change, to address themselves not to the whole nation or even to its liberal elements, but just to its political and corporate leadership, to its so-called "power structure," and to speak as race leaders, not as popular or national leaders. That is what opponents of reform covertly or unconsciously welcome. For, if unemployment, poor learning in the schools, or crime in the streets are allowed to be seen as Black problems (or Puerto Rican or Chicano ones) they will likely never be solved, and their persistence year after year will only deepen and re-confirm, all racial stereotypes in White minds.</p>

<p>That is why one so fervently wishes that "summit" meetings of Black leaders would not merely make demands on Congress and the White House, but would see themselves, as their predecessors of a decade ago did, as the reform leaders of this nation, and would boldly claim the allegiance that is rightfully and historically theirs. Unemployment, bad schooling, and crime are not racial problems, no matter how many Blacks or Hispanics may be trapped in them. They are national problems, residues of inequitable political and economic systems, and the responsibility of all of US.</p>

<p>There is nothing I know of in the history of our times to lead one to believe that political office holders or corporate executives will do much about these tough and very real problems, unless the sort of Black and White multitude that demanded the reforms of 1964 and 1965 again come into being.</p>

<p>It is time for Black leadership to call upon White liberals to come back home. To do it, Black leaders will have to accept the fact that today Hispanic leaders must stand beside them. And it must be done without rancor; the time for scapegoating 'liberals" is past. There will have to be an effort made to understand liberal devotion to causes like peace, anti-militarism, the sanctity of the environment, and the dignity and aspirations of women. But it is time for liberals to come back to the cause they slipped away from, the unfinished business of equality; and it is time for Black leadership to summon them. There has been enough knocking at the door of Washington and Wall Street. Those 50 percent Black youth unemployment rates will go downward only when the kind of liberal mass that brought about the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is made again to know what democracy requires of it.</p>

<p>Energies have not, of course, been dormant. Possibly never in the history of our nation or any other have they so flourished. Those energies ended a wretched war in Vietnam, threw hard punches at the CIA and the government's other lawless snoopers, probed the Pentagon, weighed obstacles to industry and consumer ravages of the environment, built countless and durable, if small, new community organizations, fought for the rights of children, hungry people, mental patients and prisoners, and gave women a new vision of themselves. And it all began in the heat of Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia and the rest of our South, just as was born here the impulse that has stirred Hispanics and Indians, and just as came from here the deeper resolve of people in southern Africa. And it all serves the same end, and though that end may not be as holy a one as the "beloved community" it is a good and lovely one nonetheless, of men and women living at peace with each other and with nature.</p>

<p>The South has had, as Vann Woodward put it, the burden of its own
history. The South has also, of course, been a burden to the rest of the country. It still is, though becoming less of one. Its senators and representatives are almost never to be found at the forefront of good works. On the other hand, they are not, in anything like the degree they once were, barriers to the satisfaction of national<pb n="5"/> needs.</p>

<p>I have spent some time recently studying certain votes of this 94th session of Congress, and I think what one can currently report is that the Southern delegations are about as bad or as good as the rest of Congress: which is a milestone in the further Americanization of Dixie, no doubt helped along by a Georgian at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. There is no distinction among the Southerners, certainly no Estes Kefauver or Frank Graham, nor anymore a Sam Ervin, William Fulbright, or Lister Hill who, though terrible on civil rights, would partially atone by distinguished service in some other area.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the age to which I've arrived, but all the world these days seems dominated by mediocre talents; in art, literature, science, philosophy, wherever, the days of genius or even brilliant sparkle seem gone, for a while. It would be too much to expect that Congress would rise above, or even up to the level of conquering modern mediocrity; and it does not.</p>

<p>If not generally worse than their colleagues, Southern congressmen and congresswomen do still sometimes hear the old tribal drums. Southerners in the House voted better than 2-1 to build the B-1, even over Mr. Carter's opposition; but in the old days, not a third of them would have resisted the military. So one may take what consolation he can from that.</p>

<p>The worst display of Southern militarism came on the vote whereby Mr. Carter's all-too-modest program to upgrade the less-than-honorable discharges of Vietnam veterans (which in disproportionate numbers were Black and other minorities) was mean-spiritedly put down by the House by denial to them of all veterans' benefits. Only one representative of those states that once had themselves been in rebellion, Joseph Fisher of Virginia, voted for compassionate justice for those many thousands of young victims of our war-making in Vietnam.</p>

<p>One Vietnam veteran put the case exactly, though futilely, in a statement to a sub-committee of the House: "Those possessing bad discharges are already so burdened by unemployment, poverty, and lack of education that the benefits would have provided some new ray of hope to an otherwise dark future. One wonders why some congressmen persist in policies that result in holding down those who are already at or near the bottom." (Interestingly, although nearly all the rest of the "Black Caucus" were against this punitive bill, Representatives Harold Ford and Barbara Jordan were not, choosing to stand with the Southern bloc rather than the racial one. May they find a better issue the next time they do! To their credit, both of them did vote against the B-1, as did nearly all the rest of the "Black Caucus.")</p>

<p>On abortion, the Southerners in the House stood about 5-4 against on the many votes that have been taken in 1977 on the crucial issue of the use of Medicaid funds, a ratio no worse than the rest of the House (but one as good as it is only because of the astonishing support of the Carolina delegations). There have been so many votes taken on this issue in 1977 that an exact picture of where legislators stand is hard to come by, but on the votes in the Senate that I have examined Southerners are voting a consistent majority for the pro-abortion position.</p>

<p>If the tribal drums seem to be responded to less readily, the leading strings of economics seem about as tight as ever, all flighty talk of Southern populism notwithstanding. Sixteen of the Southern senators voted, against Carter, to end price controls for newfound natural gas. A bill in the House to end federal farm subsidy payments to absentee corporations came within a surprising eight votes of passage, but only 19 of its supporters were from the South. And so it goes. One could add more examples, to the point that Southerners in Congress seldom fail to wait on the interests of big oil, big finance, big farms, and big money in general.</p>

<p>I have gone to this length into congressional behavior for two reasons. One is to suggest to you that the South has a different political position than it used to have in relationship to the rest of the nation. Southern Blacks and White liberals used to look to Washington for indispensable help in solving their problems. That long lasting period of political dependency is now so close to being over that we may as well call it finished. Now the South must play its full part in the resolution of national issues, and has no excuse for not doing so.</p>

<p>Secondly, I wanted to suggest - and here I unashamedly speak as a liberal - that the South must play its part in the great liberal causes of our day. It was wrong, morally and politically unacceptable, for a Hill, Fulbright, or Ervin to be "good" on other issues, and reactionary on civil rights. It would be also wrong and unacceptable for a Southerner today to excuse his positions on war and peace and militarism, on secrecy and surveillance, on ecological necessities, on the economic rights of the poor, on the dignity of women, or on the claims of other minorities by doing a good turn here and there, or even many of them, for civil rights. When one bears of possible or actual support for an Eastland or Wallace or Thurmond, how dearly can one say the old dreams are valued?</p>

<p>I had an experience some years ago, in one of my first visits among
Indians of the Southwest, which made me vividly realize something
Black friends bad been gently and tactfully telling me, but that I had
not heard well. I sat with some Indians one day, and they began
attacking me- <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! for policies and actions of
the Government in Washington. It struck me forcefully that they
weren't distinguishing between me, tthe possibly,<pb n="28"/>
somewhat prideful critic of politicians and bureaucrats, and those very fellows: all one, all pale face. I've come to accept this. I can accept the fact that to a Black person, dealing with a White liberal may be only a variation of dealing with a White segregationist: all one, all White. It is beside the point. For the point is, to build a society at peace, with itself and other societies, to build a society with_ in which all men and women, and their children too, can find decent and dignified lives. And in the service of that purpose, we have all equal duties.</p>

<p>Our politics is throwing up men (e.g. Nixon and Agnew; you can add
other, and many, examples) whose instincts are not for life and not for civilization, but for their destruction. Such men are a revolt against evolution. These are men who have the smell of death about them. But we are all infected with that plague, or else we would not elect and reelect such people. We lust for skill, we admire it and are infatuated with it, and we admire its possessors, those who can deal efficiently with the "system." But being smart in dealing with the " system" is small potatoes in this nuclear age. These men who govern us are the custodians of <hi rend="italic">life</hi> itself.</p>

<p>Speaking about women, Erik Erikson once wrote that "True equality can only mean the right to be uniquely creative." I believe the same can and must be said of Blacks, of Hispanics and Indians, of White ethnics long cast down; must be said of Africa and Asia and Latin America as they come into the councils of nations. What America wants and what the world wants is not simply for new groups to share in its few privileges, but for those new folks to bring with them their own rich insights and understandings, for them to shape society to themselves and not they to it and its death-ridden ways.</p>

<p>Talk like that sounds more out of place today than it did when Baldwin said he didn't want to be integrated into a burning house. All I can say is that I have little faith that the house won't burn unless those who, in our region and nation and world, are cut off from its power and riches find or create ways to make the economy and politics serve them, adapt to them, rather than be their suffocating embrace.</p>

<p>New ideas and values have more often than not come from "new" people, i.e. people newly emergent into social consequence. The world has no need for a "Black political theory" or a "female" one either; nor for a "Black" or a "female" theology, or life style, or what have you. But it is likely, I believe, that the thinking which may give birth to sanity in our lives and culture will be bred, is being bred, in the experiences and insights of being Black (or Hispanic, or Asian, or American Indian) or being woman.</p>

<p>And so I conclude by speaking again to you as Southerners, and as
one who wants still to think of himself as a Southerner, and to such,
and as such, say that I don't like that bastard label "sunbelt." The
"sunbelt" is, at best, nothing more than an expanse of land and
sunshine, at worst a place replete with problems you don't need. To be
a "sunbelter," if that's what it is called, is to be a rootless,
non-historical person: and that, no matter what else, no proper
Southerner can be. The South is not merely a geographical term. We are
too far down the road of time for that. The South's identity, all that
it has to offer, is a history, and a spirit dragged and wrenched from
it. A spirit that, at its deepest, knows that life - mere life - is
worth all, because it can come back another day and is, anyway, in the
final judgment all we have; and knows that each of us has claims on
each other that may be denied for long, but not forever. Let the
burden of Southern history be transformed now into the message of
Southern history. Let the South stand publicly for what it has always
stood privately since 1865, for life, for the tenacious holding on to it and for the unavoidable sharing of it.</p>

<p>I To some it may seem ironic that "human rights" became the government's announced foreign policy when a Southern moderate became president. Let us now not stop to ponder causes for that, but only give thanks for the event, while we closely and critically watch for its carrying out. If that policy grows out of a truly Southern understanding of the rightful needs of humanity, it will everywhere stand for the protection of life and the equal claims of all to it. And if so, the South would have turned the burden of its history into a lovely gift to our republic, and to human kind.</p>

<head>Tommy Lee Hines and the Cullman Saga</head>
<docAuthor>By Bob Dart</docAuthor>
<docDate>Vol. 1, No. 3, 1978, pp. 12-15</docDate>
<argument>
<p>Bob Dart is a staff writer for the <hi rend="underline">Atlanta Constitution</hi>.</p>
</argument>
<p>Squatting in the marbled hallways, the wrinkled hangers-on, found in any country courthouse, chewed and digested the carryings-on that had descended upon their town.</p>

<p>"We've never had enough niggers in this county to amount to nothing anyway," allowed one oldtimer. "And what we had, stayed in their place. Now this thing will get them stirred up and it won't ever be the same here."</p>

<p>In the paneled courtroom upstairs, a Black man with an IQ of 39 - the guile and wisdom of a six-year-old child - stood accused of raping a White woman. Up Highway 31 a piece, the Ku Klux Klan and Black civil rights marchers - both awakened by the case - had been eyeball to eyeball at the town's city limits a few days earlier.</p>

<p>Now in the courthouse, the weathered old men in faded bib overalls and narrow lapeled suits sensed that no matter what the trial's outcome, things would never be the same in Cullman. Southern justice was on trial here; an old and a new South were clashing once again.</p>

<p>But the winds of change never stirred a small, silent man upstairs. Tommy Lee Hines slumped in his chair as strangers dissected his life, debated his fate, and all the while looked beyond the textbook law case they were writing. The 26-year-old retarded Black man understood little of what was happening to him, his family and friends said. For what is history to a man who can't remember the days of the week?</p>

<p>"He was seven before he ever talked," his daddy recalled. "But he was always a good boy. Always minded. Anything you'd tell him to do, he'd try to do it. He never sassed me or his mama. I never heard him say a cuss word."</p>

<p>Tommy has always been special, his family and neighbors recalled. "I always knew he was different from the rest of my children. I had nine boys and three girls, you know," explained Richard Hines. "But he ain't crazy. I'll tell you that. He's retarded; just different."</p>

<p>Tommy Hines never attended public school as a boy, his neighbors said. There were no facilities for a "special" Black boy growing up in Decatur, Ala.</p>

<p>"Everybody knew Tommy," said James Guster, a neighbor of the Hines family in the northwest side of town - the Black section. "When we'd see him, he'd always be with relatives. We never saw him by himself."</p>

<p>So Tommy Hines grew up insulated from the outside world by a
protective family. "You know, that boy has never been to a picture show in his life.. he don't know a<pb n="13"/> nickel from a quarter," his father said. "I never let him out to play much. Bigger boys would try to hurt him. He got knocked down once trying to play football. I couldn't let him get hurt."</p>

<p>Tommy Hines was past 20 when he started to school. The Cherry Street School - a center f or retarded persons - opened in Decatur and he was enrolled. After a battery of tests, the center declared that Tommy Hines is trainable, with a moderate retardation level. He could learn to do some tasks but could never function in society by himself.</p>

<p>"The thing I remember about Tommy is his big smile when he told me 'I go to the Newcomb Street Church of Christ and I was baptized by Brother Alphonso Robinson,' said Joel Loftin, a state official who tested Hines. He said he was moved that the two of them - worlds apart in intellect - had been touched by the same faith.</p>

<p>Officials at the Cherry Street School testified that Hines attended regularly and caused no trouble. Rosemary Wright, the White secretary at the school, said she sometimes went alone with Tommy to pick up school lunches.</p>

<p>"He was always well-mannered and very quiet ... well behaved. He was a gentleman."</p>

<p>But in the courtroom, a White man and a White woman painted a different picture of Tommy Lee Hines.</p>

<p>Decatur Police Detective Doyle Ward testified that Hines had been picked up for questioning after being spotted in a neighborhood where he was a stranger. The official said he thought the young Black man matched the description a rape victim had given of her attacker.</p>

<p>Under gentle questioning, Ward said, Hines had confessed to three rapes and had led police to the scenes of the crimes.</p>

<p>"I went by the train station, and I saw a girl I knew who worked there ... When she went to her car, I grabbed her, and she tried to get away . . ." Hines allegedly told the police. He reportedly supplied details of the sexual assault on a 21-year-old clerk at the railway station.</p>

<p>The victim in the case said her attacker had worn a plastic garbage bag over his head, like a bonnet, but had left his face uncovered. In court, she pointed out Tommy Lee Hines as that attacker.</p>

<p>A bevy of defense witnesses attacked these stories. His teachers and testers said Tommy Hines was incapable of relating the confession that Ward testified the retarded Black man had told in his own words. The language of the confession is much too sophisticated for Hines, the school officials said.</p>

<p>Others who knew him said Hines was frightened of "authority figures" and would likely admit to anything he thought they wanted to hear, just to please them.</p>

<p>Asked the question, "How many women did you rape, two or three?" Hines would pick one answer, just guessing to try to be right, a defense witness said.. He told the police "three."</p>

<p>A trusty at the Decatur jail testified that Tommy Hines was crying and praying loudly the day he allegedly confessed, the day police said he talked calmly and lucidly to them.</p>

<p>Richard Hines testified the police "wouldn't let me see my boy (after his arrest). They shut the door in my face ...told me he (a policeman) didn't have time to talk to me."</p>

<p>But the prosecution stood unshaken; the woman said Tommy Hines raped her and a policeman had a confession he said Tommy Hines dictated and signed.</p>

<p>The verdict would come from an all-White jury, nine men and three women picked from the populace of Cullman County, Ala.</p>

<p>Most of Cullman County's 52,000 residents would just as soon have had the Tommy Lee Hines trial stay in Morgan County, where the rape occurred on Feb. 16,1978. But a change of venue - a legal quirk -brought the case and an unsought notoriety to the rolling farmlands and sleepy county seat of Cullman.</p>

<p>"Folks in Cullman ain't mad at Hines," said a state trooper assigned to guard the courthouse. "They're mad at that judge in Morgan County who sent his trial over here."</p>

<p>Less than one percent of Cullman County's population is Black, and most of them live in an area outside of town known as The Colony. It's a church-going county - not a legal drink to be brought within 50 miles - with a faded row of single-story storefronts lining Highway 31, the town's main drag.</p>

<p>Cullman is a good place to live, its residents claim, and there had been little racial tension before the Hines trial arrived. "We have our coloreds in The Colony down there," said one resident. "They're treated as good as any Whites. They just stick to their business and we stick to ours. Their kids go to school with ours."</p>

<p>"I've sold cars to the niggers around here for years, said another
man. "They pay on time just like the White folks." The White residents blamed a Black protest movement that took place in Decatur after Hines arrest for the move of the trial.<pb n="14"/></p>

<p>"They (Blacks) never had any organization in Decatur before this," a state trooper said. "But they seized on the case and used strong-arm tactics to organize. Then the Klan recruited for the first time in years. Tommy Hines is a scapegoat, caught between two radical factions. It's really kind of pathetic."</p>

<p>The "outside agitator" that northern Alabama Whites blamed for arousing the local Blacks is the Rev. Richard B. Cottonreader, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference project coordinator in the Hines case.</p>

<p>"I got involved when some local people put in a call to the national office," Cottonreader recalled. "They wanted help so I was sent over here (from Gadsden, Ala.). I tried to arouse the community as best I know how.</p>

<p>"I don't consider myself an outside agitator. I consider myself one of the best things that could have happened to Decatur at the time." Cottonreader organized a long, hot summer of protests and confrontations with the KKK that thrust the Hines case into the national spotlight.</p>

<p>"It's amazing what you can accomplish sometimes," said Cottonreader, a slim man of 47 given to wearing denim outfits and a silver cross. "SCLC was needed here. We opened the eyes of the nation to the Tommy Lee Hines case. If we hadn't been here, he would have been just one more Black on trial for rape."</p>

<p>Indeed, the protests also awakened the long-slumbering Klan of
northern Alabama. Once again burning crosses lit pastures and white-robed and hooded men spit out words of racial hatred.</p>

<p>Klan membership "skyrocketed" in Alabama, said KKK Kleagle Bill McGlocklin. "I look upon this as a rebirth of the Klan," the Decatur service station owner said. He became an open Klan leader, he said, after reading that a Black organizer had said, "We're going to get a piece of the pie in Decatur or there isn't going to be any pie."</p>

<p>The "Invisible Empire" of the KKK has changed, McGlocklin said. "It's not like the old Klan. We don't do any nightriding or burn churches. We're into politics now. You can't get anywhere with violence any more."</p>

<p>"In four years," he continued, "we want to grow so much that no one in Alabama politics - no county commissioner, state representative or governor - can be elected without the Klan's endorsement."</p>

<p>Blacks have organizations to represent them, McGlocklin countered,
so Whites need one, too - the KKK. But he said most Klansmen carry
guns and are still ready to act as vigilantes if they deem it
necessary." It's like the T-shirt says. "If you want my gun, come take it."</p>

<p>The Hines case produced a series of confrontations between the Klan and Black protesters: meetings that produced no violence but a lot of publicity. The confrontations climaxed on the opening day of Hines trial when robed Klansmen and other Whites met a group of Black marchers walking from Decatur at the Cullman city limits. Several of the Black marchers ended in jail.</p>

<p>Behind the protesters came a rash of rumors; tales the Klansmen and their sympathizers seized upon and embellished. "I know for a fact the Black Panthers are ready to come in," a self-styled "Concerned Citizen" said outside the Cullman courthouse. "They're staying at motels all over north Alabama, came from Atlanta, New York and Detroit. They get $32 a day expenses."</p>

<p>The White men gathered each day under a pecan tree outside the
courthouse and discussed how to handle the invasion of Black radicals they believed was coming. If<pb n="15"/> Hines were convicted, they said, the Black groups had vowed to burn Cullman to the ground.</p>

<p>"The first one that strikes a match, his head comes off," said one Cullmanite. "This is not Detroit. This is Cullman, Alabama."</p>

<p>Across the courthouse parking lot from the tight knot of White men, young Black men and women from Decatur ate their lunch each day during a break in the trial of Hines, their neighbor. They, too, had heard rumors - of Klansmen ready to perform their own brand of justice on the young Black man. Two young Black men drove Hines to and from trial each day and stayed near him, calling themselves his bodyguards.</p>

<p>"We ain't the same folk the Klan scared 20 years ago," a woman in an Afro observed. "They're dealing with a new Black man and woman."</p>

<p>In northern Alabama, the Tommy Lee Hines case had awakened a racial confrontation that many felt had been put to sleep forever in the violent 60s. A veteran of 16 years with "the Movement," Cottonreader said "Alabama appears to have changed a bit on the surface, but only on the surface. Racism," he explained, "has gone underground."</p>

<p>He said that once he moved in to work on the Hines case, he found other changes that were needed. "Alabama's changing, but Decatur is more behind than the average town," he said. "Tommy Hines was the straw that broke the camel's back. I believe that Tommy Hines is a special person chosen by God to bear a cross for the Black people of Decatur."</p>

<p>Sitting silently in the courtroom in a tan leisure suit, Tommy Lee Hines slumped uncomfortably, his dark eyes darted around toward the unfamiliar faces. Friends said he was unaware of what was going on; unknowing of the racial and legal turmoil his situation had caused.</p>

<p>"Hell, sometimes he doesn't even know who I am," said Harry Mims, one of Hines' attorneys. He said his client hadn't been able to help his defense at all.</p>

<p>The courtroom drama winds slowly down. The trial takes two weeks and the expected violent Black-White confrontation never comes.</p>

<p>The case boils down to whom the jury believes. A White woman says Tommy Lee Hines raped her. A White policeman says the young Black man confessed to the crime. Hines' teachers, family, friends and state psychologists say he is retarded, incapable of committing such a crime. Tommy Hines himself says nothing.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Mike Moebes says Hines' mental abilities are not the issue. "Retardation is not a defense," he said.</p>

<p>The all-White jury deliberates for three hours before returning a verdict: Guilty.</p>

<p>Judge Jack Riley sentences Tommy Lee Hines to 30 years in prison and congratulates Moebes for doing a "tremendous job."</p>

<p>Hines' attorneys vow to appeal. Newsmen are ready to file their final story on the Hines case, eager to get on with the next assignment. Then judge Riley asks Hines if be has anything to say.</p>
<p>No, sir," mumbles the small man. No one knows for sure what Tommy
      Lee Hines thought then, as state troopers led him to a car and
      jail. The "special" boy his family had sought to protect, the
      man with the mind of a six-year-old child, the man "with a cross
      to bear," the convicted rapist - simply gazed mindlessly ahead.</p>

<head>Tupelo: Hometown in Turmoil</head>

<p>"Hey, they got a jitney jungle," a Black kid with a Michigan brogue exclaimed to his traveling companion as the bus wound its way into the small Mississippi town. "That's boss," he concluded with approval. This link to his own home in the North suddenly elevated the South a bit in his esteem.</p>

<p>I awoke from a semi-doze at the kid's words and looked out the window. I caught sight of a shopping center to my right and a fairground to my left. The streets were deserted and clean. As we pulled into the station my eyes scanned the top of the city's courthouse and the police station. A view of the downtown shopping area, only a couple of blocks down the street, was cut off by some buildings.</p>

<p>Feeling a tinge of excitement, as I always did when arriving in this place, I aroused my sleeping four-year-old on the seat beside me.</p>

<p>"Wake up, honey," I told him. "We are in Tupelo. Mama is home!"</p>

<p>It was a pleasant June evening, so pleasant that when I called the
house for a ride from the bus station and found the line busy, I
decided to walk the four blocks home. With bags in hand, my son and I
walked north up the quiet familiar streets. The breeze was gentle and
warm. When we reached Spring Street, I looked down out of habit to
where my brother has a shoe store/shop. It is in the block with the
pool hall, a cafe and the supermarket that gives
<pb n="17"/>
credit, an area that for years has been dominated by rural Blacks coming to town on Saturdays.</p>

<p>Although my little boy and I were two Blacks walking the streets of Tupelo, Mississippi at ten o'clock at night, it did not occur to me to be afraid. My only concern was that some dog might spot us and make a fuss. Yet, this was the same Tupelo that one reporter graphically described that summer as a place where "a war of sorts" is being fought in the streets and "to some in this racially divided northeast Mississippi trading center, your skin is your uniform." It wasn't that I was unafraid of meeting some hooded Klansman patrolling these streets, the thought merely did not occur to me. For me, this was simply home, the place where I had grown up, where my mother and most family still lived and the place that I loved to visit much more frequently than I had the opportunity. It was, too, the place where, ironically enough, I felt most safe.</p>

<p>Our walk home that night was uneventful. Except for an occasional remark from me to my son, who was quieter than usual having just awaken, the walk was made in silence. Not even a resident dog acknowledged our presence.</p>

<p>On the surface, Tupelo appeared to be the same uneventful town that I grew up in during the fifties and sixties. At that time, although White families occupied the last three houses on my street - houses of comparable sizes and conditions - the similarities ended there and our paths rarely crossed. Racial confrontations between us were practically nonexistent.</p>

<p>On school days, I and my Black friends and neighbors beaded north to school and my White neighbors -certainly not friends - headed south or westward. Some of my schoolmates came from a further distance south, from a poorer, more dilapidated area across the tracks called Shake Rags.</p>

<p>When I was in school, it was a rare occasion for Blacks to get their pictures in the paper regarding school events. I can recall following the activities of the White girl my age that lived on my street through various newspaper clippings. Although we grew up within a few feet of each other, we never had an occasion to actually meet. She was always a popular girl and one year she was chosen one of Tupelo High School's beauty queens. I remember reading the different newspaper accounts with a mixture of pride and envy - pride because a girl from my street was featured in the paper and envy because the same kind of coverage was denied to us Blacks.</p>

<p>All of that has changed now. A few years ago one of my nieces was chosen "Miss Tupelo High." Her Black face graced the pages of the paper that had denied our existence ten years before. Now, it is not at all unusual to see Blacks pictured alongside Whites in photographs of school activities.</p>

<p>School desegregation in Tupelo had been another of those uneventful occurrences. Black parents here, unlike many others, both North and South, have few - if any - horror stories to tell about school integration or busing. Total integration of the schools in Tupelo exists and children from all over the city now head in the same directions for school without incidence.</p>

<p>Another visible change in Tupelo since the fifties and sixties is in housing. The reely structures in Shake Rags that used to house a large percentage of the Black population have been torn down and replaced with a housing project in the north end of town. Blacks are also moving into apartment buildings and complexes and some homes that were for "Whites only" a few years ago. Most important of all, "nice," attractive brick homes are darting up constantly, bearing witness to the fact that Blacks in Tupelo are indeed progressing.</p>

<p>At least, this was the appearance of things. Because a temporary halt had just been called to the picketing while a recently-formed biracial committee held negotiations behind closed doors, this quietude easily belied the fact that "a war of sorts" was being waged here. The spring and summer of 1978 had been anything but quiet in Tupelo.</p>

<p>The Black community that laid dormant, for the most part, throughout the turbulent sixties when Blacks in many other Southern towns were raising up in protest of racial discrimination, had at last taken a stand and declared racial discrimination to be very much a factor in their town. They bad shocked the White community and some Blacks by calling and supporting a boycott of White merchants that was 80 percent effective in protest of police brutality and job discrimination. And in so doing, they had inflamed the radical element in the White community and brought forth the long-subdued Ku Klux Klan in numbers and force unknown in recent times. Near confrontations between demonstrating Blacks and countering Klansmen became common occurrences that spring and summer.</p>

<p>While actual racial confrontations seldom had occurred in Tupelo, an analysis of the city by the United League, a state-wide civil rights organization first invited to the area to help stage demonstrations in protest of police brutality, revealed that Tupelo had one of the worst records in the state in terms of racial discrimination.</p>

<p>The analysis showed that Tupelo with a population of approximately 27,000, of which around 25 percent were Black, bad very few - and in some cases - no Blacks in decision-making positions.</p>

<p>According to a spokesman for the League, at the time the analysis was done, with the exception of one alderman, there were no Blacks in city government in decision making positions; there were no Black store managers in any of the department stores or supermarkets; a brother of mine, appointed a few years ago after the schools were integrated, was the only Black on the school board. In no instances were Blacks employed in the workforce in proportion to their percentage of the population, except in menial positions.</p>

<p>There had always been grievances that needed to be addressed. I
remember that in the sixties when I was in college my community's lack
of activity was a source of some embarrassment for me.
<pb n="18"/>
According to Attorney Lewis Meyers of the North ' Mississippi Rural Legal Services the unique economical situation of Blacks in Tupelo has been a major factor keeping race relations "good."</p>

<p>In Tupelo, the per capita income and the standard of living is high compared to many other areas where the plantation/sharecropping system needed only raw, unskilled labor. With Tupelo as a mercantile center, Blacks moving into northeast Mississippi were a bit more well-to-do. These middle-class Blacks became the traditional "Negro" leadership, Meyers recounts, and bad heretofore been successful in keeping the peace in Tupelo. They were a buffer zone for powerful Whites who were the ones the Black landlords and the funeral directors and the store owners had to face downtown on the bank board when they needed capital. Because of "interest tied to capital" the White power structure had been able to rely upon these Black leaders to "keep the peace.</p>

<p>Life began to change, however, after the Vietnam war drained the Black community and left scores of young, vibrant Black men jobless. The veterans that returned to the South in a recession to face unemployment in their hometowns and states, were a different breed from the ones a generation' before. Disillusioned by the war, most faced no jobs, lack of stimulation and lack of direction. They were in no mood to let the peace be.</p>

<p>One of the forces which channeled this unrest into protest was Alfred "Skip" Robinson, a building contractor from nearby Holly Springs and founder of the United League, a grassroots organization that claims 35 chapters and about 70,000 Black members throughout northern Mississippi. According to Robinson, a middle-aged father of six, he gave young Blacks an identity, a sense of direction and a sense of purpose. Even his detractors admit that they are impressed with his ability to arouse the interest of the Black community. Walter Stanfield, a League organizer, says that Blacks in Tupelo have been willing to deal with past grievances, but until the League came to town, there was no organization around to provide the necessary leadership.</p>

<p>Robinson does not sound like the sixties' leaders. He speaks of old problems with a different perspective. "We are not trying to integrate the neighborhood schools," said Robinson. "In so many ways, integration was the worst thing that ever happened to Black people. We lost so much of our identity, things that were our own. Before integration there were more Black school principals in Mississippi than anywhere else. Now, around here, you can count them on one hand. We are taking up where the movement of the 1960s left off."</p>

<p>Since Robinson's leadership and the League's work, there have been several important victories. For one thing, League-led protest resulted in the removal of the two officers from the police force that were implicated in the brutality suit. Not only that, but according to Stanfield, a Black building inspector has been named to the city government structure and a Black assistant has been assigned to the light and water department. Also Blacks have reportedly been hired as store managers in two stores and in several cases have received jobs that they would not have received otherwise. Meyers said, "We've gotten more people around here jobs than Mississippi Employment Service ever did."</p>

<p>However, Robinson is increasingly being criticized for his uncompromising position by both Blacks and Whites. Several Blacks voiced their frustration over his refusal to negotiate on a settlement. Mary Douglas, a young Black mother who marched with her children on the picket line and later served on the biracial committee created to air grievances for the city, referred in particular to a meeting that included Mississippi senatorial candidate Charles Evers. Robinson had been so late for that meeting, it had to be rescheduled.</p>

<p>The Rev. William Rittenhouse, pastor of the biracial committee, said he saw Robinson's continual failure to negotiate as a "betrayal of willingness to work problems out." Aaron Henry, state NAACP president, denounced Robinson's behavior as an attempt to exploit the situation to gain power for himself and his movement.</p>

<p>The animosity between the League and the traditional Black leadership has also divided the Black community. League members have frequently referred to old leaders as "Uncle Toms" and suggested on one occasion that since they bad not done anything for the Black community in all this time, maybe it was best they stay out of things now.</p>

<p>Many of the League members are so-called "street people" - the chronically unemployed, some with minor criminal records and former drug users - some of the established leaders point out. If they cut themselves off from us, they ask, where are they going to go when they need people to fill the leadership positions they are seeking?</p>

<p>Kenneth Mayfield, the local Black attorney who brought the police brutality suit sparking the protest was one of a group that extended the imitation to the League to organize in Tupelo. Despite the divisions, he is optimistic. He feels that all things considered what has happened in Tupelo in recent months has been -good."</p>

<p>As a result of some of the activities over the past seven months,
grievances have been brought to the fore and a "framework has been
set" for finding solutions to those grievances. Mayfield is on a
committee with four Whites that has been designated to draw up an
affirmative action
<pb n="19"/>
plan for the city to be approved by the mayor and the board of aldermen. The plan will attempt to increase jobs and representation of Blacks by Blacks, particularly, in the areas where they are most affected.</p>

<p>Mayfield has little doubt that the city administration will approve an affirmative action plan. In order for the " sore to heal," he says, the city must come up with an affirmative action plan.</p>

<p>A weekend visit to Tupelo in late October again found the city undergoing a quiet period. A "silent" boycott was on, but a lot of Black residents had gradually begun shopping again in the White-owned stores.</p>

<p>The League's activities had been halted while they awaited the affirmative action committee report. The Klan reportedly busied itself that weekend by making an appearance at a high school band festival. A group of robed Klansmen supposedly walked past a group of young Black teenage boys and girls on the street and, as they passed, one of the boys, to the amusement of the other kids, grabbed the band flagpole and jestured at the Klansmen, 11 show you who's afraid of who."</p>

<p>All fear of the Klan appears to be gone from the Black community. Their main importance in Tupelo this whole period, one observer noted, has been in providing theatrics for the media. While the presence of the Klan did much to draw attention to the area, Rittenhouse feels that the situation in Tupelo was blown out of proportion indeliberately by the press. Although Blacks and Klansmen openly displayed weapons, no violence erupted, he pointed out.</p>

<p>However, Tupelo, the "All-American City," with its symbols of growth and progress in northeast Mississippi, has had difficulty in explaining why this 'littleness in thinking," as Rittenhouse characterizes the Klan, experienced a rebirth in their town. Many Tupelo citizens have, frankly, been embarrassed by the whole situation.</p>

<p>The city now quietly awaits the results of discussions to what will be tomorrow's situation. This time amid the quietude I sensed that something was indeed transpiring. Maybe it was the undercurrents of a grassroots organization again mapping strategy, or the Klan regrouping, or more division taking place among the Black community, or maybe it was simply a city making plans for a communal Thanksgiving Dinner as Ritterhouse, the Baptist minister, would like to think.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the change was within me - my perceptions. For, I had realized that Tupelo was indeed a battleground for racial issues not because it caught up with the protest of the sixties ten years later -not because of any one individual or organization. Instead, Tupelo had become the nation's best known town for racial conflict largely because of the people and events which have grown since the civil rights movement. Like other places in Mississippi or Massachusetts, Tupelo's signs of progress may have given most Whites the opinion that race relations are good" and many Blacks a reason to expect more.</p>

<p>In this way, quiet or in turmoil, my hometown is everyone's. Tupelo
is our town.</p>
