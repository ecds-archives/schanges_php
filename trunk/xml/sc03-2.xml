<head>An Era of "Pride and Hope" 1979</head>

<p>As we celebrate this new beginning, I want to explain as clearly as my command of the language will allow what kind of governor I will try to be.</p>

<p>Like anyone else, I will tend to make decisions that reflect the
values and principles I have come to cherish over the years of living and struggling to grasp what understanding I can of the human condition.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have believed passionately in the cause of equal opportunity, and I will do what I can to advance it.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I have deplored the arbitrary and abusive exercise of power by those in authority, and I will do what I can to prevent it.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have rued the waste, and lack of order and discipline that are too often in evidence in governmental affairs, and I will do what I can to diminish them.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved the land, air, and water of Arkansas, and I will do what I can to protect them.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have wished to ease the burdens of life for those who, through no fault of their own, are old or weak or needy, and I will try to help them.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have been saddened by the sight of so many of our independent, industrious people working too hard for too little because of inadequate economic opportunities, and I will do what I can to enhance them.</p>

<p>Today, we begin anew the people's business in a time that is
confusing, uncertain, and sometimes difficult to understand. In the
recent past, we have learned again the hard lesson that there are
limits to what government can do&#x2014;indeed, limits to what people can do. We live in a world in which limited resources, limited knowledge, and limited wisdom must grapple with problems of staggering complexity and confront strong sources of power, wealth, conflict, and even destruction, over which we have no control and little influence.</p>

<p>Let us not learn too much of this lesson, however, lest caught in the thrall of what we cannot do, we forget what we can and should do. We are a people of pride and hope, of vision and skill, of vast capacities for work. We have the prospect, for which we have waited so long, of economic growth which does not require us to ravage our land and so to reject our heritage. We have the immeasurable benefit of living in a state in which the population is sufficiently small and widely dispersed for people of all kinds still to know and trust each other, still to believe in and work together for the elusive common good.</p>

<p>We have an opportunity together to forge a future that is more remarkable, more rich, and more fulfilling to all Arkansas than our proud past, and we must not squander it.</p>

<p>There is much to be done.</p>

<p>In education, we have lingered too long on or near the bottom of the heap in spending per student and in teaching salaries. We must try to reverse that. However, we must be mindful that higher quality education will not come from money alone. The money must be but part of a plan which includes better accountability and assessment for students and teachers, a fairer distribution of aid, more efficient organization of school districts, and recognition of work still to be done in programs for kindergarten, special education, and gifted and talented children.</p>

<p>In energy, we have been too undisciplined and tardy in our efforts
to
<pb n="18"/>provide for future energy supply that we need for sustenance and growth at prices the people can afford. The Energy Department I have proposed will attempt to marshall and intensify our efforts to promote conservation, develop alternative energy sources, and develop more effective and fairer utility regulatory policies.</p>

<p>In human services and health care, we have a great deal to do,
especially for those at the far ends of life's spectrum&#x2014;our senior citizens and children. The proposals of this administration will provide to senior citizens tax relief, a uniform probate code, greatly expanded and improved home health care, and advances in nursing care. For children, we will seek to complete an effective care network for those who are emotionally disturbed and to create a system of perinatal care that will be a model for the nation.</p>

<p>In economic development, we must move quickly to intensify advances all across our state and to make more efforts for more development in the areas of our state that need it the most. The Economic Development Department I have proposed will lead this effort with its new emphasis on marketing our products abroad, expanding existing enterprises at home, and more vigorous attempts to help local communities help themselves.</p>

<p>Last evening, after our gala, a friend of mine from Washington who
travels this country and speaks to many groups in many places, said
that he felt in that crowd two emotions which are not found in other
places today: Pride and Hope. Pride and Hope. With those two
qualities, we can go a long way. We can bring on a new era of
achievement and excellence&#x2014;we can fashion a life here that will be the
envy of our nation. The future lies brightly before us. With pride and
hope, and the grace of God to take our hands and lead us on, we shall
not fail! Thank you, and God bless you all.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">The Rise of Southern Suburban Politics</hi></p>

<p>Ronald Reagan's victory in 10 Southern states, leaving the President only his native state, showed in fact a divided south&#x2014;with Black voters overwhelmingly supporting Carter and an enormous number of Whites voting for Reagan.</p>

<p>Although their candidate lost, Southern Blacks' clear choice was Jimmy Carter. In 78 targeted predominantly Black precincts in nine southern states (excluding Arkansas and Texas) Carter received more than 86 percent of the vote. Both urban and rural Black support for the Democratic presidential ticket was strong throughout the region. In fact, more than two out of three of all the Black boxes surveyed showed Carter with better than 90 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>On this basis of precincts' patterns, nine out of 10 Black southern voters cast their ballot for Carter. This degree of support exceeded national projections of 80 percent Black support for Carter.</p>

<p>Selected county returns confirm the depth and breadth of Carter's
support among Southern Blacks. Of five Deep Southern states surveyed
(North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia)
Carter lost only three majority Black populated counties among the
more than 70&#x2014;and those three were all in Mississippi. Within
the same states, only nine of more than 130 counties with at least 40 percent Black population failed to give a majority of their votes to Carter.</p>

<p>The overall White voting patterns show the opposite trend: Southern Whites voted in large numbers to defeat Carter. In the 23 predominantly White&#x2014;largely urban precincts in nine states surveyed in the South, election returns show Reagan with almost 70 percent of the vote. In fact, Carter failed to carry a single box within the targeted precincts.</p>

<p>Southern White voters were not for Reagan as uniformly as Blacks
were for Carter. The Democratic presidential ticket carried, for
example, 20 of the 50 mostly rural counties in North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi which have more than 90
percent White population.</p>
<pb n="7"/>

<p><hi rend="bold">Final Count: Black/White Choices for 
President</hi></p>

<p>In November, Jimmy Carter lost the South in the suburbs. Unlike 1976, the 1980 Presidential election shows Carter's failures and Reagan's strengths in the Southern metropolitan areas, especially outside the central city.</p>

<p>This Democratic slippage in the South's presidential politics is nothing brand new. As far back as 1968, when George Wallace campaigned as a third party candidate, the Democratic party's candidate has been unable to deliver a majority vote in the South nor more than one Southern state's majority except in 1976 (Chart 1).</p>

<p>In most Southern states Reagan carried the balance of the suburban counties. In Alabama, Mobile and suburban Baldwin counties voted Republican as did the three other expanding suburban areas&#x2014;Dothan (Houston and Dale counties), Birmingham (Tuscaloosa, Shelby, Jefferson, St. Clair, Blount, and Walker counties) and Montgomery (Montgomery, Autauga, and Elmore counties).</p>

<p>A close analysis of Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas illustrate how Reagan won (Chart 2). In a breakdown of the voting returns by counties in the metropolitan areas (as defined by the 1970 U.S. Census Bureau) of these states, the voters in all suburban counties except one, gave Reagan a majority. Only in the metro counties where a central city is located did Reagan fail to pick up overall voter approval.</p>

<p>In the New Orleans area, for example, the three suburban parishes surrounding the city delivered more than 60 percent of the vote for Reagan while only 40 percent of the New Orleans' parish voted for him. In South Carolina, the central city vote did not even reduce markedly Reagan's strength. All metro counties supported the Republican president.</p>

<p>In Texas the only suburban county to vote for Carter was San Patricio outside of Corpus Christi. Because it is small, rural and has a significant Hispanic population, San Patricio is hardly a typical suburban county and, hence does not really defy the pattern of suburban support for Reagan.</p>

<p>Republican strength in these counties made the difference often in the final state returns (Chart 3). The ten metro parishes in Louisiana gave the new president more than half his total state's support. The seven South Carolina counties&#x2014;among the state's forty-six&#x2014;delivered almost half the Republican president's votes and in Texas the metropolitan counties' Reagan votes constituted three-fourths of the state's total.</p>

<p>The Southern pattern of Reagan's voting strength is
convincing. Although the margins of victory for the Republican party
in each Southern state were not overwhelming, Republicans have
captured the support of those Southerners living outside of central
cities and in suburban areas&#x2014;where the South's population is steadily
growing. It is what professionals in the business of vote getting call
"a growth pattern" and the basis for the Republican hopes for 1984 in
the South.</p>

<head>The Good Ole Boys Club Prevails: Mississippi Legislature</head>

<p>0nce questioned about the odd language used by lawyers in drafting legal documents, a law professor at Oxford, Mississippi, listened to a law student contending that legal pleadings use archaic terms and the style should be modernized. The professor tongue-in-cheek replied, "What we need are not more modern pleadings; what we need are more archaic law students."</p>

<p>This theory of "legal reform" did apply for many years to the Mississippi legislature where pleas for more progressive legislation were met by the addition of more reactionary legislators. However, a growing number of persons with bright minds and a view to Mississippi's future, not its past, now occupy seats in both the Senate and House of Representatives. There are seventeen Black lawmakers, fifteen more than in 1979, primarily due to court-ordered reapportionment. In addition to long-time Black leaders Aaron Henry and Henry Kirksey, the Black caucus boasts well-groomed newcomers such as Hillman Frazier, a George Washington University Law School graduate and former legislative draftsman, as well as Jackson attorney Fred Banks. A new wave of White legislators, including Ivy League educated Gerald Blessey, Jackson's Ed Ellington, and Dennis Dollar of the Gulf Coast, is striving to move Mississippi forward.</p>

<p>The Mississippi legislature, nevertheless, remains in the clutches of "the ole boys club." Black gains still leave minority representation at about ten percent in a state which is thirty-eight percent Black. Of the entire legislature's one hundred and seventy-four members, there is but one woman.

<p>Despite new blood, the Mississippi legislature is still not the place to go for fast action. Very little legislation of any signigicance gets as far as the floor. As one lobbyist put it, "It's easier to block bad legislation than it is to get good legislation passed."

<p>The 1981 Mississippi legislature looks to be carrying on that standard. Early in the session, which began January 6th and will close March 31st, the Speaker of the House, C.B. "Buddie" Newman, requested members to read and consider the legislation assigned to their committees. He then added that "sometimes we help people more by what we don't do," but that he did think that the bills should be read.

<p>Speaker Newman, a Delta farmer, holds immense power by having control over committee assignments. A telling, if inconsequential example, of his dominance, drew laughter from the gallery and took place a few minutes before a joint session in January. The senators were late getting into the House chamber. A motion was made to delay the session until they had time to get in. "All in favor say 'aye,'" the Speaker said. No one bothered. "All opposed say 'no.' "A chorus of goodnatured "No!" rang out. "The 'ayes' have it," the Speaker concluded and retired to wait for the senators.

".. . sometimes we help people more by what we don't do."

<p>Gathered into what was once Jackson's Central High School, which has been remodeled to accommodate the legislature while the $18 million renovation of the capitol takes place a block away, this year's legislature has heard and heard again that the state is in financial straits, that there is little money for new or expanded programs. In spite of this warning, the medicaid bill, which had been given much attention by the press, has already passed. Had this appropriations bill not been enacted, the Medicaid Commission would have had to cut services to patients due to a budget deficit.

<p>Governor William Winter, whom many view as the most able chief executive in the state's history, has placed education at the top of his priority list. His bill to provide for the establishment and funding of public kindergartens, something Mississippi has never had, is still alive and given a good chance of survival. The compulsory school attendance bill, repealed in the 1950s, will not be reinstated this session as the governor had wanted. Governor Winter has also stressed the development of forestry products and methods of handling industrial wastes.

<p>Mississippi remains one of only six states that does not have
either court decision or statute requiring landlords to comply with
minimum housing standards. This legal protection for tenants will not
be granted again this year. The bill was not voted out of committee by
February 5th, the deadline for committees to send legislation to the
full House. The Fair Pulpwood Sealing and Practices Act, designed to
attack some of the problems of the state's estimated 10,000 pulpwood
cutters and haulers, bled to death after being gutted by the Ways and
Means committee. Some progressive
<pb n="13"/>
measures dealing with jail conditions, domestic abuse, and accountability of state schools for the deaf and blind remain under consideration. A bill calling for open business and meetings of state boards has a good chance of passage.

<p>But no other real reform measures seem likely to be pushed through this session. Those who look to the Mississippi legislature for modern reform may look back in the spring and conclude, in the words of Leonard PenthDarnel, television's "Saturday Night Live" and former host of Bad Opera, "There, that wasn't so good, now was it."
