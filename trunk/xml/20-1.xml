<p>Across the country, conservatives are realizing that affirmative action will not easily be eliminated through state legislative action. Despite sharp attacks in the courts and reports that state legislators from coast to coast are preparing to eliminate state affirmative action programs, during 1996 and 1997 only thirteen states actually introduced such legislation, and none of these bills was successful. And only one state, Washington, expects to have an initiative similar to California's Proposition 209 on the ballot in 1998. Events in 1998 show that affirmative action is still very much a viable force in America. In fact, those working to repeal affirmative action on the state level see themselves engaged in a difficult and potentially unsuccessful struggle.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this news will end the widespread perception that the foes of affirmative action constitute, as <title>The New York Times</title> put it in November 1997: <q direct="unspecified">"The national movement that has often seemed to have the momentum of an unstoppable freight train."</q> It was a prominent report in the <title>Times</title> a year earlier, along with stories in <title>The Atlanta Constitution</title>, <title>The Dallas Morning News</title>, and other papers, that left the false impression that almost half the states were on the verge of eliminating their affirmative action programs.</p>
<p>In November of 1996, Sam Howe Verhovek of <title>The New York Times</title>, wrote that twenty-six states had introduced anti-affirmative action legislation that year. According to his assistant, Verhovek got the figures from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), a non-partisan organization that tracks state legislation. Yet, a closer look at the NCSL 1996 affirmative action report reveals that while twenty-six states introduced some form of legislation concerning discrimination and affirmative action, fewer than half that number of bills in 1996 actually sought comprehensive repeal. Indeed, some of the legislation was offered to support anti-discrimination laws. Though Verhovek correctly noted that <q direct="unspecified">"not a single bill passed,"</q> his numbers took on a life of their own.</p>
<p>Similar figures were cited in an October 6, 1997 story by Scott Shepard of <title>The Constitution's</title> Washington Bureau and one by David Jackson in the <title>Dallas Morning News</title>. Jackson reported that <q direct="unspecified">"Up to 30 states are preparing referendums similar to Proposition 209,"</q> while Shepard stated that nineteen states had anti-affirmative initiatives or legislation in the works.  Jackson's figures came from the American Civil Liberties Union, and he admitted that he may have exaggerated a lithe. The ACLU's publicity office in New York claimed their number of twenty-five to thirty states came from, again, <title>The New York Times.</title></p>
<p>These inflated estimates have had the effect of making the opponents of affirmative action appear stronger and more successful than they actually are. Here are the facts: in the 1997 state legislative sessions, bills amending state constitutions or statutes to repeal affirmative action were introduced in: Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, and South Carolina. The intent and wording of all of these are similar to Proposition 209, as they seek to <q direct="unspecified">"prohibit discrimination and preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in public employment, public education or public contracting."</q></p>
<p>In every case in 1997, the bill or referendum was either <q direct="unspecified">"postponed indefinitely,"</q> or held in committee, the "graveyard" of legislation, as one bill sponsor commented. While the situation is more precarious in Washington State and Ohio, the sponsors in the remaining states lack confidence that their legislation will succeed any time soon.</p>
<p>Affirmative action opponents find themselves in the curious position of claiming that public opinion is on their side, and that the majority of Americans no longer want affirmative action, while their legislative and initiative efforts are thwarted due to lack of support or concern from voters, business and community leaders, and even fellow conservatives. Efforts in Houston, Colorado, Florida, and Georgia demonstrate that defenders of affirmative action can be successful. <q direct="unspecified">"Not only public opinion, but momentum, is on our side"</q> concludes Brian Komar of the Leadership Conference of Civil Rights.</p>
<p>In at least three states, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Michigan, the battle to eliminate affirmative action has been laid to rest for now. The sponsors of anti-affirmative action bills in these states are not planning to re-introduce the legislation that they pushed weakly last year. Missouri state Senator Peter Kinder (R-Cape Giradeau) says that he did not even press for a hearing of his bill (SJR 3) because he <q direct="unspecified">"knew it wasn't going to go anywhere."</q> He does not see similar legislation being enacted in the <q direct="unspecified">"foreseeable future."</q></p>
<p>Likewise, Oklahoma state Representative Bill Graves (R-Oklahoma City) and sponsor of FUR 1010, asserted that affirmative action is "probably pretty safe in Oklahoma." In Michigan, Representatives Michelle McManus (R-Lake Leelanau) and David Jaye (R-Washington Town ship) collectively introduced three pieces of legislation in 1997, all of which were held in committee. An aide to Representative McManus explained that they were encouraged to move last year because the Republicans controlled the House, but this year, with Democrats in control, they feel it "would be fruitless" to press further. Affirmative action is probably secure in the northeast.</p>
<p>While representatives in New York and New Jersey are planning to re-introduce legislation in the next session, they are not expecting the bills to go forward. When controversy heated up in New Jersey in 1997, sponsors of Assembly Bill 2533 lost some support when fellow Republican Kevin O'Toole of Cedar Grove, backed into a "mend it, don't end it" position. O'Toole then pro posed his own compromise bill Assembly Bill 2748, which would give preference to the "economically disadvantaged." Even this more liberal bill was held in committee.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Battleground States</hi></p>
<p>More difficult battles await affirmative action proponents in Ohio, Washington State, and the Carolinas, but recent events in Arizona and Georgia indicate defeat is by no means inevitable. In North Carolina, representative Edwin Hardy (R-Beaufort) is ready to re-introduce his anti-affirmative action referendum, HE 981, in 1999, if he gets re-elected in 1998. As a referendum, Hardy hopes that the legislature will let it through so "the people can decide." If the fate of affirmative action were left to public vote, Hardy feels certain that it would be repealed. De spite his optimism, representative Howard Hunter, a Democrat from Conway and former chair of the state Legislative Black Caucus, called Hardy's bill "a dead deal," adding that affirmative action is <q direct="unspecified">"a battle we are going to have to fight, but it won't be that bill."</q></p>
<p>In <hi rend="bold">South Carolina</hi>, the situation is more complex but no more hopeful for opponents of affirmative action. Alter a racially divisive debate, the South Carolina House voted 74-37 on February 19, 1998 in favor of a bill that would force state government agencies to drop affirmative action programs, including admissions and scholar ship programs at public colleges.</p>
<p>The bill is currently in the Senate Judiciary Commit tee, but few believe it will ever pass the majority-Democratic Senate. Representative James McGee III (R-Florence), who replaced the bill author Representative Hunter Limbaugh last November, says, <q direct="unspecified">"I can tell you right now it's going to be killed in the Senate."</q></p>
<p>With this knowledge, House Republicans have continued to push the issue, attempting unsuccessfully to attach an anti-affirmative action measure to the state budget on March 4, 1998. <q direct="unspecified">"This time was different because the Black Caucus had an opportunity to tie the bill up,"</q> says Representative Joe E. Brown (D-Richland County). <q direct="unspecified">"We [the Black Caucus] don't have enough power to pass something, but we do have enough to stop some things."</q></p>
<p>After the March 4 defeat, the chances look slim for opponents of affirmative action this year. <q direct="unspecified">"The only chance that this measure would pass the Senate would be if it had been tacked onto the budget bill,"</q> says Micheal Sponhour, who has been covering the issue for The State newspaper in Columbia.</p>
<p>In <hi rend="bold">Arizona</hi>, three anti-affirmative action bills were introduced in the 1997 session, two conventional bills and one referendum, like his North Carolina counterpart, the sponsor of the referendum, Tom Home (R-Pheonix) is certain that had his bill passed the legislature, the people of Arizona would have voted to repeal affirmative action. In 1997 as a freshman representative, he backed off from the bill because he did not have support from either Republican Governor Fife Symington, or other Republicans in the legislature. With Republican Governor Jane Hull now in office following the indictment and mid-term resignation of Governor Symington, Home reintroduced his bill in 1998. Home's measure was defeated 11 to l9in the Arizona Senate on February25, 1998 with seven Republicans joining all twelve Democrats.</p>
<p>Anti-affirmative action bills were more successful in <hi rend="bold">Colorado</hi>, with one passing the House before being postponed indefinitely. The first, HB 1299, sponsored by representative Vicki Agler (R-Littleton), was held by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Representative Mark Paschall (R-Jefferson County) subsequently withdrew his bill, HB 1336, from Senate consideration because he knew he could not battle it through, and if he did, Governor Romer would veto it. In the 1999 session, however, Paschall plans to introduce a referendum, which would both bypass a Governor's veto and not require a two-thirds majority. Agler, however, believes this statute will fail as well be cause of the lack of support in the senate.</p>
<p>Most recently in <hi rend="bold">Ohio</hi>, Representative Mike Wise (R-Broadview Heights) and state Senator Gene Wafts (R Galloway) introduced two resolutions modeled after Proposition 209 which would place a Constitutional amendment repealing affirmative action on the November1998 ballot. These resolutions are unlikely to pass. Mark Potts, a legislative aide in Watt's office, is "not overly optimistic." Wafts' bill would need a two-thirds majority, and while there are sixty-six Republicans in a House of ninety-nine representatives, at least two or three Republicans have already come out against the bill. House Speaker, Jo Ann Davidson (R-Reynoldsberg), is quoted as saying, <q direct="unspecified">"I would be very surprised to see that resolution come out of committee."</q></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Republicans Lack Consensus</hi></p>
<p>The situation in Ohio and Arizona is representative: bills are stalling because there is not a Republican consensus. In every instance in 1997, anti-affirmative action legislation never made it out of committees, not only because Democratic members voted these bills down, but certain Republicans have as well. In North Carolina, for instance, Hardy's bill was held up in the Judiciary Committee by a tie vote cast by a Republican. Even if brought to a floor vote, these bills would need unanimous Republican sup port to pass, which they do not have, as evidenced by 1998 votes in the Arizona and Georgia legislatures. Eleven Republicans voted for a Democratic-sponsored substitute to defeat a Republican-led repeal of affirmative action programs in Georgia (See Georgia article, page 20).</p>
<p>Those working to eradicate affirmative action in the states explain Republican legislators reluctance to come out strongly behind such legislation as a matter of political expediency rather than a disavowal in principle. According to Ann Kramer of the American CMI Rights Institute (ACRI), a curiously-named national anti-affirmative action organization based in Sacramento, California, <q direct="unspecified">"legislators do not have the courage to stand up for this issue."</q></p>
<p>Indeed, on the federal level, several bills have effectively been killed by leading Republicans, including Newt Gingrich (see "Legislation Blocked," page 5). Affirmative action is not an issue that congressional Republicans want to take head-on in an election year. As stated by John Miller, vice-president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative Washington, D.C., think-tank, <q direct="unspecified">"the anti-preference movement is at a standstill."</q></p>
<p>When not ignoring or avoiding the issue, Republican responses to these federal and state roadblocks have been twofold. In some cases, Republicans have proposed bills that would force revision of affirmative action programs without ending them all together-the "mend it, don't end it" approach. One example is Kevin O'Toole class- based, affirmative action bill in New Jersey. In Michigan, representative Michelle McManus's two bills (RB 4457 and HB 4459) would only require that public affirmative action policies be reviewed by the state Civil Rights Com mission in order to ensure that they conform to recent Supreme Court decisions, as opposed to the Joint Resolution put forward by her more conservative colleague, David Jaye, which would eliminate affirmative action all together. Although a spokesperson for McManus stated that McManus and Jaye worked together to push these bills, he added that <q direct="unspecified">"we are not really confident that we need to eliminate affirmative action everywhere."</q></p>
<p>Legislators have proposed these "compromise bills" in order to stimulate anti-affirmative action activity, but they have had the unintended effect of stalling action by dividing Republican support As Vicki Agler said of affirmative action in Colorado, <q direct="unspecified">"It's not a winnable battle in the legislature it's just not."</q> One alternative is to appeal directly to the public through grassroots initiative drives. Indeed, California ended affirmative action not through its state government, but through such an initiative campaign. The American Civil Rights Institute and its grass roots network the American Civil Rights Coalition were founded by Ward Connerly, the businessman who spear headed California's Proposition 209 campaign, in order to provide support and guidance to groups seeking to organize such efforts. Other states have been slow to go along.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Focus on Washington State</hi></p>
<p>As it stands, only Washington State appears to be poised to overturn affirmative action through the ballot in 1998. Initiative 200 received 280,000 signatures, over 100,000 more than are required for it to appear on the ballot. In the past two years, initiative drives begun in Colorado, Illinois, and Florida have failed due to lack of support-they simply could not obtain enough signatures to make it onto the ballot. An initiative drive in Ohio is still in its earliest stages -- but organizers in that state need 335,000 signatures to qualify for the November ballot. Only twenty-four states even allow initiatives, and the ACRI admits that in many of these affirmative action is not a burning topic. <q direct="unspecified">"We can't take this issue to Wyoming," says the ACRI's Ann Kramer, "It's not going to be sold nationwide."</q></p>
<p>Much can be learned from states that have fried initiative campaigns. Anti-affirmative action campaigners in Washington for Initiative 200 have been successful (indeed, they obtained more signatures than any other initiative in the state's history) due to a shrewdly devised campaign, a supportive Republican-controlled legislature, and the lack of a strong opposition. National figures like Steve Forbes and Bill Bennett offered free publicity in the form of speeches and commercials. (John Carlson, a Tacoma talk-radio host and newspaper columnist, used his show and columns to advertise for the initiative. He has since been fired.) And while Washington's Democratic governor, Gary Locke, has come out against the initiative, Republicans control both the state house and senate. The initiative will first be put before the legislature, which may vote whether or not to enact it immediately into law. Because the legislation is an initiative, it would have no veto power. And even if the legislature votes it down or takes no action, the initiative will go directly onto the November1998 ballot. Activists on both sides of the issue are currently lobbying legislators for their vote. Washington State affirmative action proponents know they have a big battle ahead. The NAACP has formed a coalition with a cross-section of minority and women's groups across the state, which is trying to educate the voters in Washington about the intent of the so-called "Civil Rights Initiative." They had a small victory when they were able to expose that the initiative campaign had duped some African American volunteers into thinking they were working for a civil rights cause.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Language Is Key</hi></p>
<p>Carlson and his compatriots have been very calculating with their use of language, focusing the issue on "preferences," "quotas," and "discrimination" rather than "affirmative action." <q direct="unspecified">"I don't mind affirmative action at all," says Carlson, "as long as it is done through expansion and outreach programs."</q> In this way, the initiative campaign appears much more liberal than it actually is. But, the Washington initiative uses the same misleading language that is credited with Proposition 209's success in California. Experiences in Colorado and Florida, however, demonstrate that initiatives can be defeated. Affirmative action there is, for now, relatively secure, largely due to coalition efforts to sway public opinion against anti-affirmative action campaigns. An initiative drive stalled in the planning stages when it became clear there would not be enough signatures to make it on the November 1998 ballot According to Kramer, the anti-affirmative action forces will re-group next year, and try for the year 2000.</p>
<p>Supporters of affirmative action in Colorado continue to prepare for battle to ensure that Representative Paschail's upcoming statute in l999willbe defeated and to lay the groundwork to counter any future initiative action. Members of the Colorado Progressive Coalition, based in Denver, credit the defeat of last year's bills to their efforts. According to activist Soyun Park, <q direct="unspecified">"We were able to kill those bills because we didn't just hold a press conference, but we held press conferences thong with rallies, and other grassroots efforts -- phone calls and letters."</q></p>
	<p>Bill Vandenberg of the Colorado Coalition adds that members deferred legislative action by rallying outside the capitol and filling committee rooms; with these rooms filled, legislators were forced to find other times and places to convene. The Coalition also gathered support from local businesses, labor organizers, community organizations, and students.</p>
<p>For 1998, the Colorado Progressive Coalition has already mobilized a larger network, called Colorado Unity, made up of minority, women's, and other progressive organizations across the state. They will continue the tactics they used last year, but, in order to be more proactive, they are seeking to broaden their base with a statewide education effort. On Martin Luther King Day, they launched a series of teach-ins and community forums on college campuses and within local communities.</p>
<p>Colorado Unity has modeled its efforts on the successful recent campaign organized in Houston to over come an anti-affirmative action initiative. The Houston initiative, which sought to eliminate affirmative action in public hiring and contracting, and which won enough signatures to be on the November 5 ballot, was defeated by a 54 percent to 44 percent margin. Pro-action coalition efforts rallied businesses, labor groups, women's groups, students, and individuals. The Houston coalition also had the public support of Mayor Bob Lanier, and the financial support of local and national businesses.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Corporate Role Critical</hi></p>
<p>As things stand right now, affirmative action's immediate salvation might just come from corporate support. Initiatives cost as much money as any other kind of political campaign. Initiative planners must raise at least one dollar for every signature they need. According to organizers of Florida's "Civil Rights Initiative" anti-affirmative action drive, their campaign is failing precisely because they have not been able to find adequate financial support. To qualify for the November 1998 ballot, the initiative needed 435,000 signatures by January 1, a goal they did not reach. The problem according to Initiative chairman Pat Bainter, was money. They needed five- hundred thousand dollars, an amount they did not come close to raising through individual donations. Former chairman of the Initiative, Orlando businessman John Barry explained that although he received some	donations from wealthy individuals, he needed financial support from either the Republican Party or big businesses. California's Proposition 209, for instance, really took off when the GOP came on board, providing one-quarter of the campaign's total finds. Free advertising and publicity has complemented the individual donations that have fueled Washington State's initiative.</p>
<p>According to Florida and Washington organizers, businesses have not backed their campaigns because they fear losing customers. <q direct="unspecified">"They don't want people picketing them,"</q> says Bainter. Likewise, Carlson explained that Washington businesses have not gotten involved with his initiative because <q direct="unspecified">"big business is reluctant to take risks, to get into the fray."</q> But, as experience in Houston shows, businesses are not necessarily neutral on the issue. They are not only reluctant to back anti-affirmative action campaigns for fear of customer boycotting, but they also realize that affirmative action, or at least its primary effect -- diversity -- is good for business. The 1995 Federal Glass Ceiling Report found that affirmative action not only widens the "pool of talent" businesses can draw from in hiring, but also that businesses recognize that they need to reflect the diversity of the marketplace and its customers.	Affirmative action defenders can enhance their power to defeat these initiatives by gaining corporate support and dollars.</p>
<p>In Ohio, anti-affirmative action organizer B.J. Kresnye is hoping to circumvent the money problem by seeking support from state Republicans. Indeed, Ohio is the only state with both an initiative in the works and pending legislation in the state legislature. Kresnye says that he does not have the time, energy, or money to see this initiative all the way through to the ballot, adding that <q direct="unspecified">"no one has the ability to do what Ward Connerly did, devote heart and soul to the initiative."</q> Kresnye's goal is to goad Ohio legislators into passing the bills put forward by	Representative Wise and senator Watts. But, according to Wise's aide, Mark Potts, state Republicans have not paid much attention to Kresnye's actions: <q direct="unspecified">"the Republican Party is interested in supporting Republicans, not specific issues."</q></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Honda's FREE Coalition Seizing Initiative</hi></p>
<p>Anti-affirmative action organizers in Florida face the same problem, receiving only lukewarm support from Florida Republican party. Although some Republican legislators and candidates, including Jeb Bush who is running for governor this year, are sympathetic to the goals of the initiative, they are reluctant to take a public stand. A spokesperson from the Senate majority leader's office stated outright  that <q direct="unspecified">"affirmative action is just not an issue for Senate Republicans,"</q> adding that an anti-affirmative action initiative would not be as successful in Florida as in California because <q direct="unspecified">"Floridians just don't have the animosity they have in California."</q> Florida anti-affirmative action organizers are planning to regroup and try again in the year 2000. The NAACP in Florida has already begun proactive efforts to ensure affirmative action survival in the state. In order to galvanize public support, the NAACP has formed a coalition with other minority groups and business leaders entitled FREE, or Floridians Representing Equity and Equality.</p>
<p>The purpose of the FREE coalition is not to defeat the initiative, which they do not see as a looming threat. As Larry Colleton, legal redress for the Florida NAACP says, <q direct="unspecified">"deep down we don't think this initiative is going anywhere . . . but we are not going to throw caution to the wind either."</q> Director of the Florida NAACP, Leon Russell agrees: <q direct="unspecified">"We are not going to attack John Barry [original initiative organizer]....We're not going to give that initiative any publicity; instead we are going to present positive action."</q></p>
<p>The goal of FREE is to implement a pro-active, pro-affirmative action campaign-to beat affirmative action foes at their own game. Their strategy is two-pronged. First, they have presented a proposal to the commission appointed to review the Florida Constitution (a revision that occurs every twenty years and is underway this year)  which asks for an amendment allowing state agencies and Florida's political subdivisions to undertake affirmative action where there is evidence of the current effects of past discrimination. Secondly, FREE is organizing a signature campaign to get this Constitutional amendment on the November 1998 ballot Russell estimates that such a campaign will cost one-and-a-half million dollars, an amount he says can be raised with corporate backing. FREE is proposing a pro-affirmative action initiative. As affirmative action is already in place in Florida "state agencies and its political subdivisions," such an amendment would only bolster its position, and demonstrate the state's commitment.</p> 

<p><hi rend="bold">California Not the Norm</hi></p>
<p>Ultimately, California may turn out not to have been the norm, nor the standard-bearer, but rather an anomaly. Vicki Agler of Colorado believes that state groups that would otherwise support anti-affirmative action initiatives are laying low because only a few states have similar plans. <q direct="unspecified">"The reason [Colorado initiative planners] are backing off," says Agler, "is because they don't want to be the only state."</q> If only one state works toward an initiative, they fear pro-affirmative action groups like the NAACP or the ACLU will pour all their resources into defeating that initiative. By waiting until several states can pool together and put forward initiatives, anti-affirmative action groups can "diversify the resources" of affirmative action supporters.</p>
<p>Whatever state-based movements may attempt, the baffle over affirmative action also will continue to be fought in the courts. Most recently, the Center for Individual Rights, which fought and won the Hopwood case in Texas in 1995 (which banned affirmative action in University of Texas admissions), has brought suit on behalf of two white students against the University of Michigan's affirmative action admissions policies. And in 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld California's Proposition 209 and earlier refused to hear the Hopwood appeal. The justices had decided to hear Piscataway vs. Thiman, which involved the decision to fire a white teacher over a black teacher in the Piseataway, New Jersey, school system, but a settlement by the parties and major civil rights organizations removed the case from theft docket.</p>
<p>The current state-by-state situation demonstrates that affirmative action opponents do not constitute a great tide sweeping the nation, precisely because they are not reflecting public opinion. (See survey article, page 22.) Law makers and pressure groups who are pushing to end affirmative action are facing stumbling blocks, not only from Democrats but from many Republicans as well as from businesses who do not want to alienate their public, and from voters who want to retain affirmative action or at least its effects of diversity and equity. As Brian Komar of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights explains, <q direct="unspecified">"It is clear there is broad enough support among the American public to block or defeat extreme efforts seeking to eliminate affirmative action programs for women and people of color. It is unfair that current coverage does not reflect this reality."</q></p>

Overcoming Disparities Yields Economic Benefits</head>

<p>Opponents like to argue that affirmative action divides; the reality is that the failure to overcome persistent inequality divides Americans. Affirmative action is necessary to ensure equal opportunity and racial, gender, and ethnic diversity in our country's workplaces and schools, not only to compensate for past discrimination, but to remedy the economic inequalities that persist today, largely because of past injustices. Racial and gender disparities in income levels, material wealth, and professional and educational opportunities continue despite progress. Evidence shows that where affirmative action  has been applied, it has been beneficial. </p>
<p>Before looking at the benefits of affirmative action, it is useful to see the income and educational disparities between white males and the groups targeted by affirmative action.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Income Levels</hi></p>
<p>Recent figures on income levels illustrate persistent inequalities between employed white Americans and employed people of color.</p>

<p>	College-educated black men make 73 percent of what college-educated white men make.</p>
<p>	College-educated black women make 98 percent of what college-educated white women make.</p>
<p>	The median year round income for full time male workers in 1995 was $31,496. Female workers average $22,497</p>
<p> In her 1997 book, <hi rend="italic">In Defense of Affirmative Action</hi>, Barbara Bergmann has calculated the wage gaps between minorities and whites so as to take account of income disparities that may exist because of differences in education levels, experience, and geography.  She uses figures from the U.S Census Bureau, as well as National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (for workers between 26-33; this survey also measures cognitive ability) to come up with a "residual gap" of the amount of wages lost due to discriminatory factors.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Professional Disparities</hi></p>
<p>Women and people of color comprise 57 percent of workers; this figure will rise to 62 percent by the year 2005. Yet, women and minorities are under-represented in managerial, professional, and administrative jobs.  White men are over-represented in these higher-paying  and higher-status jobs. </p>
<p>	97 percent of senior managers of Fortune 1000 industrial and Fortune 500 companies are white; 95 percent to 97 percent are men. </p>
<p>The Department of Labor's 1995 Glass Ceiling Report also found that "equal educational attainment does not level the playing field for Black men and women . . . . White men are over-represented in top positions regardless of educational level . . . . White men have 68 percent more of the executive, administrative, and managerial positions than should be expected at this educational level - all things being equal." </p>
<p>	   Women	African 			</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Educational Disparities</hi></p>
<p>In proportion to their representation in the population, people of color are underrepresented in higher education as well.  As the decline in enrollment in Texas and University of California law schools post-Hopwood, and post-Proposition 209, respectively, demonstrate, affirmative action is responsible for the levels even being what they are.</p>	
<p>	African Americans make up 9.9% of enrollment in all two-year or four-year undergraduate institutions - out of a total of 12 million students.</p>
<p>	39,754 Doctoral Degrees were awarded in 1993: African Americans received 1,106 (2.8%); Latinos received 834 (2.1%).</p>
<p>	6,496 Doctoral Degrees in the physical sciences were awarded in 1993. Forty-one went to African Americans (0.6%) and 89 to Latinos (2.1%)</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Persistent Racism</hi></p>
<p>Because so much dialogue concerning affirmative action focuses on the need to rectify past discrimination, we often forget that discrimination is not entirely a thing of the past.  Opponents of affirmative action argue that affirmative action has done its work, or that the present generation should not have to pay for the sins of the past. We need to remind folks that racism persists - and several academic studies exist that demonstrate the advantages white men still enjoy when applying for jobs or college admittance. </p>
<p>For example, a report entitled <hi rend="italic">Affirmative Action Review: A Report to the President</hi> found that when pairs of  equally qualified black and white testers applied for the same job, the white tester was either hired or advanced further in the hiring process while the black tester was turned away.</p>
<p>An audit by the General Accounting Office (GAO) found discrimination against Hispanic job seekers as well. Hispanic testers received 25 percent fewer job interviews and 34 percent fewer job offers than other testers.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Hiring Increases
in Monitored Workplaces</hi></p>
<p>It  is clear from the anecdotal and empirical evidence that gross gender, racial, and ethnic inequities still persist. In order to more effectively argue for affirmative action, its proponents need to show that affirmative action has indeed worked to ameliorate these injustices.  </p>
<p>In <hi rend="italic">Not All Black and White</hi>, Christopher Edley notes that in compiling the Affirmative Action Report to the President, he and his colleagues were surprised to find that little work had been done to prove statistically the effectiveness of affirmative action.  Most studies that exist compare private sector firms who are not obligated by federally-mandated affirmative action programs, and public-contracting firms that are under Executive Order 11246. These reports show that affirmative action has made a difference in minority employment levels.</p>
<p>Since affirmative action has been in place, federal contractors and agencies now hire many more minorities and women.  Federal Contractors that underwent a Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program (OFCCP) review in the 1970's subsequently hired more women and minorities at a quicker rate than contractors that did not undergo review, suggesting that government enforcement or checks on affirmative action does  play a significant role in minority and female advancement . In other words, if the government did not intervene, we can assume that these minorities and women would not have been hired.</p>
<p>Opponents of affirmative action argue that contracting firms suffer lower productivity and efficiency due to OFCCP regulations. However, one study actually reveals that affirmative action has had no such effect on contracting firms.	</p>
<p>Because OFCCP enforcement of affirmative action was significantly reduced in the 1980s,  it is suggested that the OFCCP did not have as great an impact on minority-hiring in contracting firms. </p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Los Angeles Times</hi>, reporting the results of their 1995 study of affirmative action, similarly asserted that "blacks . . . . have made disproportionate gains in public and private-sector jobs subject to affirmative action monitoring by the federal government."  Latino and Asian employment rates, on the other hand, are the same in both the overall work force and in government regulated jobs.</p>
<p> Detractors argue that the increases in minority and female employment are due to changes in social attitudes and conditions prompted by the Civil Rights Movement and the Women's Movement rather than the "artificial" controls exerted by the government. They use this argument to claim that the anti-discrimination laws enacted in the wake of these movements makes affirmative action unnecessary.</p>
<p> Edley concedes that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between progress due to anti-discrimination laws which apply to all employers	 and affirmative action programs that apply to federal contractors. The line between anti-discrimination policies and affirmative action policies, he recognizes, is slippery. But, he believes, as do most Civil Rights liberals, that the two policies are deeply wedded together. We can not truly enforce and achieve non-discrimination without some form of affirmative action.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Who Has Benefited?</hi></p>
<p>Studies also show that since the implementation of affirmative action, the number of minorities and women represented in higher education and in skilled or administrative jobs has increased significantly. Subsequently, income gaps between minorities and whites, and between men and women have been reduced. These studies are used as verification that affirmative action has indeed worked.</p>
These figures on income levels are provided by Bergmann:

<p>In 1967, black men's wages were 69 percent of white men's. In 1976, they had risen to 79 percent of white men.  Since then they have fallen, due in part to economic recession. </p>
<p>	Income levels for white women did not start to rise until the 1980s. In 1967, white women's wages were 61 percent of white men's. In 1995, they had reached 73 percent of white men's. </p>
<p>According to the 1995  <hi rend="italic">Los Angeles Times</hi> study,  white women and black women have made the most gains. Affirmative action programs seemed to have the most impact on white women, whose representation in professional and administrative jobs nearly tripled between 1960 and 1990. Black women have also progressed at higher rates than black men.  </p>
<p>The Glass Ceiling Report supports these findings, especially in the success rates of white women compared to minority men and women. White women made most of their gains in the 1980s.</p>
<p rend="bold"><hi rend="bold">Economic Costs and Benefits</hi></p>
<p>Opponents of affirmative action, including  John Barry of the Florida Civil Rights Initiative, have stressed the economic costs of affirmative action, since, they contend,  instituting these programs costs millions of dollars.  </p>
<p>But, according to the presidential <hi rend="italic">Affirmative Action Review</hi>, "only 40 cents of every $1,000 in Federal educational assistance funding is devoted to" minority-targeted affirmative action programming.  On the other side,  proponents of affirmative action argue that affirmative action has economic benefits. It reduces poverty by eliminating racial discrimination in employment and education, thereby allowing African-American victims of poverty to advance.  In other words, it contributes to the development of a black middle class.  Minority set-asides in federal contracting, it is argued, promote minority entrepreneurship and contribute to the economic development of minority communities. Moreover, ensuring fair representation of minorities and women in the workplace will enhance business by widening the labor pool, and by making companies and firms more representative of their communities and, therefore, more effective. </p>
<p>The Glass Ceiling Report, although it looks mostly at private corporations and does not directly address affirmative action, does provide some harder evidence to substantiate these arguments.  The Commission stressed that increasing diversity in the workplace was "good for business," because it not only widens the "pool of talent" businesses could draw from, but also because businesses realize they need to reflect the diversity of the marketplace and their customers.  It reports that "a 1993 study of Standard and Poor 500 companies shows that firms that succeed in shattering their own glass ceilings racked up stock market records that were nearly two-and- a-half times better than otherwise comparable companies." </p>
<p>The Report also points out that minorities in the U.S., that is, Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans, represent more than $500 billion a year in consumer spending. </p>
<p>Another aspect to the effect of minority and female advancement in the workplace is turnover rates.  Because of the "Glass Ceiling" effect, between 1980 and 1987, turnover rates for women in professional jobs doubled that of men.  For African Americans in the same period, the turnover rate was two-and-a-half times that of whites.  The major reasons cited for the high turnover rate for women were a lack of career growth, progress, or opportunity.  Lower turnover rates can mean big savings for companies - one study stated that lower turnover saved a pharmaceutical company $500,000 in one year.</p>
<p>Affirmative action is a necessary and effective strategy to end racial and gender inequalities in this country. While moral and historical defenses of affirmative action are important, economic reasoning might be the most potent argument to win this battle. Opponents of affirmative action cannot ignore the economic disparities that exist in this country between races-racism and inequality are not specters from our past, but persist in the present day. Affirmative action not only compensates for historical injustice, but also aims to effect racial equity and justice in the present and future.</p>
<p>Affirmative action is a social good for moral, psychological, <hi

<p>"It is preposterous," says Harvard educator Gary Orfield of the <hi
rend="italic">Wooden</hi> case, a Georgia lawsuit filed in 1997. Challenging both the affirmative action programs at the state's predominantly white institutions and the legitimacy of its historically black universities, the case illustrates some of the ironies of anti-affirmative action arguments, as well as the complexity and difficulty of eliminating vestiges of segregation in higher education.</p>
<p>This case, says Dennis Parker, who represents the NAACP LDF and the
SCLC in the suit, will determine the future of "fair access by
African-American students to higher education." The suit alleges that
the Board of Regents and Chancellor Stephen R. Portch failed to remove
vestiges of <hi rend="italic>de jure</hi> segregation from the
University System of Georgia. The Chancellor and Board of Regents, who continue to endorse the use of limited affirmative action in the system, contend that they have removed all vestiges of the "once upon a time" <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> segregation. "This case is ahistorical," Orfield continues, "It assumes a different world than what actually exists."</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Difficulties of Desegregation in Higher Education</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="itlalic">Michael Wooden, et al. v. Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia</hi> represents a disturbing challenge to desegregation efforts that continues to confront all states, but especially those where segregation was formerly mandated by law; because of the individual's choice in whether and where to apply for higher education, the government and administrators have limited powers in bringing about integration in the university system. Unlike elementary and secondary school systems, compulsory attendance cannot be used to achieve integration in higher education. </p>
<p>In 1992, <hi rend="italic">Ayers v. Fordice</hi>, the first
significant desegregation case in higher education since <hi rend="italic">Brown v. the Board of Education</hi>, reached the Supreme Court. Jake Ayers, Sr., charged that Mississippi discriminated in its educational policies by offering a dual educational system for whites and blacks, with the schools for blacks receiving inferior resources and facilities. </p>
<p>In <hi rend="italic">Fordice</hi>, the Supreme Court ruled that the state must do more than adopt race-neutral policies and identified four areas in which Mississippi's policies appeared problematic: admissions policies, program duplication "mission" statements, and the number of public institutions. In a ruling that left neither party fully satisfied, the court decreased access by raising admission standards, increased funding and program offerings at historically black universities, and rejected the proposed mergers of predominantly white and predominantly black schools. It also raised the federal standards defining a successfully integrated university system.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Complaint Charges Schools "Racially Identifiable"</hi></p>
<p>In February of 1997, Lee Parks, who earlier challenged Georgia's
majority black congressional districts, filed <hi
rend="italic">Wooden</hi> on behalf of eleven plaintiffs, seven white
and four black. The <hi rend="italic">Wooden</hi> complaint models
language used in the <hi rend="italic">Fordice</hi> ruling, asserting
that the University System of Georgia has maintained a dual system of
education with "racially identifiable" schools, program duplication,
and "mission" statements that mention race. It also appropriates the
language of <hi rend="italic">Hopwood</hi>, attacking the use of
affirmative action to eliminate the dual system. This two-pronged
attack on the University System, makes the <hi rend="italic">Wooden</hi> case unique.</p> 
<p>In language that seems to echo arguments in support of affirmative
action, the <hi rend="italic">Wooden</hi> complaint outlines a
visceral attack on the affirmative action measures used by the
University System. Rather than declaring that the barriers to equal
access and opportunity maintained under segregation have been removed
and that a "level playing field" has been achieved, the <hi rend="italic">Wooden</hi> complaint argues that those barriers remain and are quite powerful in Georgia's system of public higher education. It charges that the policies of race-based admissions used by the state to remove the barriers were mere "tokenism."</p>
<p>Gary Orfield agrees that Georgia's affirmative action policies are "tokenism." That is, however, where their agreement ends. "[Affirmative action as practiced in Georgia] is too small and, for that reason, has not done its job. The state needs much more vigorous affirmative action, not an elimination of what is already there."</p>
<p>As examples of these vestiges of segregation, the complaint does not identify the University of Georgia, the state's flagship school, where, of the over 28,000 students enrolled at the beginning of the Fall 1997 quarter, less than 2,000 (6.8 percent) were black. It does not point to the Medical College of Georgia where, of its 1997 incoming class of 129 medical students, there were no African Americans. It, likewise, does not mention that of the three other major universities and research centers in a state whose population is 27 percent black, only one has a black student population that exceeds 10 percent. </p>
<p>The complaint, instead, identifies as proof of vestiges of
segregation the three state universities whose student bodies are 88
to 94 percent black, Albany State University, Fort Valley State University, and Savannah State University. Because these institutions, originally founded to serve black students in a state that denied them  access to the better-funded all-white institutions, continue to matriculate blacks in such large proportions, the <hi rend="italic">Wooden</hi> complaint charges that they are "racially identifiable" and, therefore, represent a vestige of <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> segregation. </p>
<p>The fact that these "racially identifiable" schools accept large numbers of students into their developmental studies programs is blamed for "increasing racial segregation and perpetuating the reputation for and actual academic inferiority of the traditionally black institutions." These programs, which are not unique to the historically black institutions, offer college admission so that students who have not fulfilled all of the college preparatory requirements can do so and move on to regular college curriculum.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Plaintiffs "Remedies" Controversial </hi></p>
<p>In July of 1997, Parks submitted to the court a list of fourteen suggested remedies to eliminate the vestiges of segregation. This list of fourteen steps includes several measures that education experts feel can only harm the Georgia University System and decrease black access to public education in the state. The first "remedy" on the list would remove race as a factor in all admissions decisions even though, as the plaintiffs admit, only the University of Georgia uses race in any way in its undergraduate admissions. </p>
<p>Director of Communications for the University of Georgia Tom Jackson defended the way in which UGA factored race into its admissions process saying, "Neither race nor any other single factor, except for academic record, can cause a student to be accepted or denied admission to the University of Georgia."</p>
<p>Admission officers selected 90 percent of the 1997 freshman class
at UGA using <hi rend="italic">only</hi> the Freshman Index, a mathematical formula that combines SAT scores and high school G.P.A. The remaining applicants were evaluated using a formula called the Total Student Index. This formula still bases 68 percent of its weight on the SAT and G.P.A. but also takes into account other factors. It gives "preference" to applicants from rural areas since 59 percent of in-state UGA undergraduates in the Fall of 1997 were from the Atlanta metropolitan area. It gives "preference" to applicants who are children or grandchildren of alumni, an indirect racial preference for whites. It gives "preference" to men since women make  up the majority of UGA students. This list of criteria also, in equal measure, gives "preference" to black applicants since, though blacks make up 27 percent of the state's population and 18 percent of Georgia's public higher education applicant pool, they have never approached ten percent of  UGA students. But, as Tom Jackson stressed, "Race is never, in and of itself, a determining factor in our admissions process."</p>        <p>  Other remedies suggested by Parks include several measures that the University System instituted in a long range plan, conceived in 1996. For example, the state plans to transfer all developmental studies classes out of the state's four-year universities and into the two-year institutions by 2001. This would require that all students who did not complete the college preparatory curriculum in high school fulfill them at a two-year institution before being admitted to a four-year institution. The complaint argues that the large percentage of developmental studies students at the historically black institutions perpetuates their inferiority. The complaint omits, however, the fact that six of the nine majority-white senior colleges accepted a freshman class, in 1994, of which between 16 and 28 percent were in developmental studies programs. </p>
<p>ocation of developmental studies is a move that many fear will diminish access to higher education for blacks. According to the Southern Education Foundation, 45 percent of blacks in Georgia's university system already are enrolled in two-year schools. Although two-year colleges are, in concept, access channels to four-year higher education, they frequently do not serve that purpose in practice. </p>
<p> three historically black universities have impressive retention rates. When students enroll at these schools, they frequently return the following autumn. Fort Valley State had the highest retention rate (75.2%) for regular admission freshmen among the eighteen senior colleges in 1994; Savannah State had the third highest (69.8%). All three historically black universities rank within the top six senior colleges in regards to retention rates of black students.</p>
<p>Another suggested remedy would merge historically black Savannah State University and Armstrong Atlantic University. The fact that the two schools, both located in Savannah, have not merged is, the complaint argues, "the starkest example of how the Board of Regents maintained rather than eradicated racially identifiable schools." </p>
<p>University System spokesperson Arlethia Perry-Johnson quickly dismisses the idea of merging these two schools, "That is not a point of consideration. It is not on the table at all. [The two schools] have their own purposes and missions which have been embraced by the board." Over the past twenty years, several studies have been conducted, examining the feasibility and effectiveness of merging these two institutions. They have all recommended that the two schools remain distinct. Savannah State focuses on technology and engineering and Armstrong Atlantic focuses on education, health and criminal justice.</p>
<p>Many education experts view this suggested remedy as a direct attempt to limit access for African-American students to four-year educations. In its evaluation of higher education desegregation in the southern states, the Southern Education Foundation wrote, "Without historically black colleges and universities, access for black students-already limited-would be drastically reduced." Georgia, with only 25 percent of its first-time, full-time black students at four-year institutions attending historically black universities, is much less segregated than other southern university systems. Two-thirds of the other twelve Southern states enroll at least 50 percent of their first-time, full-time black four-year students at historically black universities.</p>
<p>Agreeing with the importance of the historically black institutions and the irony of suggesting closing or merging these schools, Gary Orfield said,  "The burden should not fall on the historically black schools to integrate. They have always been open. To close black schools would be asking black students to give up something that has worked very well without any assurances that anything would take its place."</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">State Says "Been There, Done That"</hi></p>
<p>Georgia's Senior Assistant Attorney General Alfred L. Evans,
Jr. has, in response to Parks' unique manner of stating his attack on
affirmative action, laid out a similarly unique defense. He contends
that all vestiges of the <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> segregation embraced by the state's system of higher education, keeping all black undergraduates out of the University of Georgia until 1961, have been removed. Acknowledging the "current institutional variations in racial, gender, religious affiliation, and national origin," the state argues that these variations "are the result solely of the decisions made by private individuals about going to college - whether, when, and where." </p>
<p>Though he is defending the practices being challenged by the plaintiffs, Evans does not agree with some of them. In response to the use of race by UGA admissions officials, Evans has said, "Preferences are unfair. It would be the same as saying that I want to admit someone who likes spaghetti which would unfairly exclude people who do not like spaghetti." When questioned as to preferences based on other criteria, he responds, "We have never taken the view that you can't have preferences for geography, for demographics." Evans does support affirmative action  involving recruiting and similar measures.</p>
<p>In support of this argument,  Evans describes Georgia's desegregation efforts under the guidance of the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights between 1970 and 1989. Under the OCR's guidance, the University System made substantial changes in certain areas. It increased the average per student funding, provided more than fifteen million dollars for enhancement projects, established twenty-one new academic programs at the three historically black schools, and enacted recruitment efforts to attract minority students to the majority-white institutions and to encourage students at two-year institutions to transfer to senior institutions. It also implemented several programs to locate and attract qualified minority candidates. </p>
<p>"There has been substantial investment of facilities at the historically black colleges and universities," says Robert Kronley, senior coordinator for the Southern Education Foundation, "but there is still a very long way to go to make up for the decades that the state did not invest equally in those schools."</p>
<p>In 1989, a positive OCR evaluation removed Georgia from federal supervision. According to the OCR's standards at that time, though a state was only required to comply with a federally-approved desegregation plan, not demonstrate actual changes in the racial makeup of the system or individual schools.</p>
<p>The state also cites several facts that, it argues, demonstrate that no "backsliding" has occurred since1989. Asserting that the alleged "racial identifiability" of black institutions was not responsible for the small number of minority students at the majority-white institutions, the defense correctly points out that over 80 percent of all black students enrolled in the University System were enrolled in majority white schools. Black enrollment increased 52 percent between 1990 and 1996 while white enrollment increased only 1 percent. In fall 1996, the 43,609 black students in the University System comprised 21.3 percent of the total 204,332 System students. </p>
<p>Although Robert Kronley applauds the efforts made by the University System, he stresses that, though the number of black students has increased substantially, proportionately the numbers have not increased. As a percentage of the overall University System of Georgia enrollment, black students have only increased about 6 percentage points during the six year period. Also, black representation has been falling over the past two years at the University of Georgia at Athens. Fall black enrollment dropped by 132 between 1995 and 1997.</p>
<p>The state's heavy reliance on the OCR evaluation in its defense is
also questionable. Raymond Pierce, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Office of Civil Rights explains that this positive evaluation was based on a different application of OCR's standards than are applied today. After the <hi rend="italuc">Ayers v. Fordice</hi> ruling, state University Systems were required not only to implement desegregation measures, but to demonstrate the effects of these measures as well as efforts. All states, including Georgia, that had earlier been released from supervision were warned that they could be returned to federal supervision if they were found to be harboring any vestiges of segregation. "<hi rend="italic">Ayers</hi> did not destroy the earlier criteria," Pierce explains, " It affirmed them." </p>
<p rend="centet"><hi rend="bold">Continued University Efforts</hi></p>
<p>The University System of Georgia has continued to exert a great deal
of effort to improve access to higher education. "Of the previously
<hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> segregated states in the South," Kronley says, "Georgia and Maryland are beginning to have the most comprehensive programs that work to link education from the elementary and secondary levels through college."</p>
<p>The P-16 program and the PREP program represent Georgia's efforts to build this comprehensive system. P-16, initiated in 1995, is a program designed to link the curricula of each level of the education system from preschool through bachelors degree, providing smooth transitions from one level to the next. The PREP Program, through academic enrichment programs and campus visits, helps students in at-risk situations get on the right track for admission into the state's University System. </p>
<p>se efforts are of increased importance as the University System moves to raise admission standards and remove developmental studies programs from its four-year institutions. "While we are raising the bar on one side, we are raising the level of support on the other," insists Arlethia-Perry Johnson, " This will provide a safety net so that access to education will not be diminished."</p>
<p>nley agrees. "Most states are moving now to consider higher admission standards and tougher high school graduation requirements. These are good, but only if they are phased in over time. For example, Mississippi instituted new admission standards and high school requirements in one year and the results were terrible. Georgia, on the other hand, is implementing the higher standards over a six to seven year period. That move is a good faith implementation."</p>
<p> HOPE scholarship is another example of Georgia's efforts to increase access to higher education. Funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education, the HOPE Scholarship is available to any Georgia resident who graduates from high school with a 3.0 G.P.A. and maintains that average while in a Georgia college. Although, as Gary Orfield notes, "The HOPE scholarship is financial aid distributed on a non-need basis. In effect, it compounds the inequality," it does provide a motivating incentive for student success both in secondary and post-secondary schooling.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Intervenors Seek to Protect
Rights</hi></p>            
<p>Although the state's defense challenges the plaintiffs' attempts to remove all race-based admissions, many people in Georgia do not feel represented in light of the way the state is framing its defense. This dissatisfaction has culminated in a "motion to intervene" submitted by the NAACP, SCLC, and seventeen black high school, college, and graduate students. Intervenors felt that the remedies sought by the plaintiffs would effect a drastic reduction in educational opportunities for Georgia's black students at all its four-year institutions. </p>
<p>The intervenors also assert that the defendants are unable simultaneously to represent the interests of black students and interests of the state. To represent the students' interests in protecting equal access to higher education, the intervenors contend, the state would need to acknowledge that all vestiges of de jure segregation have not been removed. Such an admission, however, could result in the state being remanded to federal supervision which is not in the state's interests. </p>
<p>The case is still in its early stages. The discovery period, during which the parties will gather information to support their cases, will continue until May 31, 1998. At that point, Eleventh Circuit U.S. District Court Judge B. Avant Edenfield will rule on the defense's motions to dismiss and to challenge the legal "standing," an ability to demonstrate personal injury, of the remaining plaintiffs. </p>
<p>Says Dennis Parker, "I expect it should go to trial this year. It is a much more straightforward case than  Ayers, so I don't expect it to last more than a few weeks."</p>
